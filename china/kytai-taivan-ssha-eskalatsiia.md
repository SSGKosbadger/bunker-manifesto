# **China's Taiwan Calculus: Assessing the Likelihood of Military Action Amid US Domestic Considerations**

**Executive Summary:**

Heightened tensions in the Taiwan Strait have become a prominent feature of international security, with persistent speculation regarding the potential for the People's Republic of China (PRC) to use military force to achieve its long-stated goal of unification with Taiwan. This report analyzes the confluence of factors that might influence Beijing's decision-making, particularly focusing on whether the current and anticipated US domestic landscape, characterized by electoral cycles and potential periods of internal instability, could be perceived by China as a propitious moment to escalate pressure on Taiwan, possibly including military intervention. The analysis incorporates recent patterns of Chinese military activity, advancements in drone technology, potential escalation scenarios ranging from limited actions to full-scale invasion, and the critical role of cyber warfare in this complex dynamic. Furthermore, the report examines potential international responses, primarily from the United States and its allies, and critically assesses how the internal political situation within the US might shape China's strategic calculus regarding Taiwan. The findings underscore a complex interplay of strategic objectives, military capabilities, and perceptions of resolve, suggesting that while the US domestic situation is a significant factor, it is but one element in Beijing's multifaceted evaluation of the risks and rewards of military action against Taiwan.

**Introduction: The Shifting Sands of the Taiwan Strait:**

The relationship between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), remains one of the most sensitive and potentially volatile geopolitical fault lines in the world. The PRC adheres to the "One China" principle, asserting its sovereignty over Taiwan and viewing the island as a renegade province that must eventually be reunified with the mainland, a goal it has stated could be achieved through peaceful means but does not exclude the use of force  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). Against this backdrop, the question of whether the current and anticipated US political landscape, marked by presidential elections and the inherent potential for domestic instability, might be interpreted by Beijing as a window of opportunity to intensify its pressure on Taiwan, possibly including military action, is of paramount importance. Understanding this intricate dynamic is crucial for maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and averting a conflict with potentially catastrophic global consequences  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). This report delves into the various facets of this complex issue, examining US policy nuances, recent Chinese military signaling, the evolving role of drone technology, potential escalation scenarios, the cyber dimension of conflict, and the spectrum of possible international responses.

**Analyzing the Window of Opportunity: US Elections and Domestic Instability:**

The US electoral cycle, particularly the presidential elections, introduces periods of potential foreign policy uncertainty that adversaries might seek to exploit. China's strategic thinkers likely analyze these junctures for any perceived reduction in US attention and capacity to respond robustly to international crises, such as one in the Taiwan Strait  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). Concurrent global crises also factor into this assessment. The ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East place considerable strain on US resources and strategic focus, potentially leading Beijing to believe that the US might be overextended and thus less willing or able to fully commit to the defense of Taiwan  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). This perception, that the US could be forced to "blink" in a standoff with China over Taiwan due to these other commitments, is a key consideration for Beijing  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]).

Furthermore, the current state of US political polarization on foreign policy issues, especially concerning China, is likely scrutinized by Beijing  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]). Differing viewpoints between Republican and Democratic leaders on the critical threat posed by China's territorial ambitions are evident, with Republicans expressing significantly greater concern  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]). While a bipartisan consensus generally exists regarding providing humanitarian and military aid to Taiwan and imposing sanctions on China in the event of an invasion, opinions diverge along partisan lines when assessing the likelihood of a direct US-China war over Taiwan, particularly depending on the outcome of presidential elections  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]). This internal debate within the US political establishment could be interpreted by China as a lack of unified resolve, potentially influencing its strategic calculations.

The specter of a second Trump administration introduces a unique element of uncertainty into the US-Taiwan-China dynamic  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). Trump's past rhetoric has questioned the long-standing US commitment to Taiwan's defense, and during his presidency, he declined to explicitly state whether the US would protect Taiwan from a Chinese takeover  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]). This contrasts with President Biden's more unequivocal statements on the matter, although these were subsequently walked back by his administration  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). This ambiguity surrounding US commitment under a potential Trump presidency could be interpreted by China as a weakening of the US policy of "strategic ambiguity," where Washington deliberately refrains from committing one way or another to Taiwan's defense  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]). This perceived shift could create a window of opportunity for Beijing to act more assertively, or conversely, the unpredictability of Trump's leadership style might also increase the risk of miscalculation for China  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]).

Beyond electoral cycles, periods of significant domestic political division or social unrest within the US could be viewed by Beijing as indicators of American weakness and a reduced capacity for international engagement. While not explicitly detailed in the provided material, historical precedents suggest that adversaries often perceive internal turmoil in a major power as an opportune moment to advance their own strategic objectives. The unpredictable nature of US diplomacy and politics in the current environment means that the potential for misunderstandings and missteps is elevated  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]).

**China's Military Signaling: Exercises and Power Projection:**

China has significantly increased the frequency and scale of its military activities in the vicinity of Taiwan, particularly since mid-2024. Data from Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense reveals a dramatic surge in PLA air incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), with the total number of flights in 2024 more than doubling the figures from the previous year  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). This escalation continued into the early months of 2025, with consistently high monthly averages of incursions observed after President Lai Ching-te assumed office in May 2024  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). These incursions often involve a variety of aircraft, including fighter jets, bombers, drones, and surveillance planes, and their increasing complexity suggests a move beyond routine patrols towards more combat-oriented training  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). The PLA has also conducted "encircling operations" of Taiwan, honing its ability to operate large numbers of aircraft beyond the island's southeastern and eastern coasts, likely in preparation for anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) operations  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). This pattern of heightened military activity is not merely coincidental; it often aligns with significant political events related to Taiwan, such as Taiwanese elections, visits by foreign dignitaries, or statements from Taiwan's government that Beijing perceives as supportive of independence  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 11]]). China has explicitly stated that these military drills serve as a resolute response to "foreign connivance and support for Taiwan independence" and a stern warning to "Taiwan separatist forces"  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 14]]).

In addition to air incursions, there has been a notable increase in PLA Navy ship sightings around Taiwan and in the Taiwan Strait  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]). China frequently reacts strongly to US and allied naval transits through the Strait, condemning them as infringements on its sovereignty and territorial integrity  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 21]]). The PLA has conducted numerous naval exercises, including live-fire drills, in close proximity to Taiwan, demonstrating its growing capability to project power and potentially enforce a blockade or invasion  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). For instance, in February 2025, China unilaterally established an unannounced live-fire zone off the coast of Kaohsiung, a move condemned by Taiwan as a dangerous violation of international norms  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]). These actions are often accompanied by assertive rhetoric, with Chinese officials asserting that the PLA will progressively tighten its "chain" around Taiwan with each successive exercise  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 12]]). Furthermore, the integration of the China Coast Guard (CCG) into these military exercises, including patrols around the entire island, blurs the lines between law enforcement and military operations, suggesting a potential strategy for gray zone tactics  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 12]]).

The normalization of high numbers of ADIZ incursions and frequent naval deployments serves multiple purposes for Beijing. Firstly, it degrades Taiwan's threat awareness and strains its resources, potentially creating a "new normal" that could serve as a precursor to more aggressive actions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). Secondly, it acts as a constant form of psychological pressure on the Taiwanese population and leadership. Thirdly, it serves as a clear demonstration of China's growing military capabilities and its resolve to achieve unification, signaling its intentions to both Taiwan and the international community  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]).

**V. The Role of Emerging Technologies: China's Drone Arsenal:**

The increasing presence of Chinese military drones in the airspace around Taiwan represents a significant aspect of Beijing's evolving military posture. These unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being deployed with increasing frequency in Taiwan's ADIZ, serving both reconnaissance and potentially offensive purposes  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). Models such as the Cloud Shadow WZ-10 and the CAIG Wing Loong II have been identified operating near the island, captured in images released by Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]). These drones offer China a versatile platform for persistent surveillance, testing Taiwan's air defenses, and potentially conducting initial attacks or contributing to a blockade scenario. Encounters between Taiwanese and Chinese military assets involving drones are becoming more frequent, with instances of Taiwanese F-16 fighter jets tracking and even locking their gunsights onto approaching Chinese drones  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). These close interactions underscore the operational reality of these deployments and the inherent risk of escalation during such encounters. Furthermore, the detection of Chinese drones operating between Taiwan and Japan's westernmost island of Yonaguni highlights the extended operational range of these platforms, suggesting China's drone activities are not confined to the immediate vicinity of Taiwan but extend into strategically significant areas  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]).

Several PLA drones, including the BZK-005 and TB-001, possess dual reconnaissance and strike capabilities  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 36]]). This allows them to provide real-time intelligence and also deliver precision strikes, making them valuable assets for both surveillance and offensive operations, particularly in high-threat environments where deploying manned aircraft might be riskier. China is also actively developing new unmanned weapons systems tailored for a potential conflict over Taiwan, including advanced "search and strike" drones and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) capable of launching anti-ship or land-attack missiles  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 37]]). The unveiling of the Feihong FH-97A "loyal wingman" drone demonstrates China's ambition to develop cutting-edge drone technology that can operate collaboratively with manned aircraft, potentially overwhelming Taiwan's defenses  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 38]]). This type of drone can perform a range of tasks, from reconnaissance and electronic warfare to conducting attacks, significantly enhancing the overall combat effectiveness of Chinese air power.

In response to this growing drone threat, Taiwan is actively developing its own drone industry with the strategic goal of becoming a global hub for drone production among democratic nations, aiming to reduce its reliance on Chinese-made systems  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 38]]). Taiwan recognizes the pivotal role of drones in modern warfare and is making significant investments in its domestic capabilities. Furthermore, Taiwan has also procured US-made attack drones, including the Anduril Altius 600M-V and the AeroVironment Switchblade 300, to rapidly enhance its defense capabilities and address the existing capability gap with China in this domain  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 40]]). These attack drones can provide Taiwan with crucial precision strike capabilities to counter potential Chinese aggression.

**VI. Potential Scenarios of Escalation: From Blockade to Invasion:**

The spectrum of potential Chinese actions against Taiwan ranges from limited military operations to a full-scale invasion. Limited actions could include the seizure of Taiwan's outlying islands, such as Quemoy and Matsu, which are geographically closer to the mainland and less heavily defended than the main island  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]). An attack on Quemoy, for instance, could be perceived by Beijing as a lower-risk option to exert pressure on Taiwan and test the resolve of the international community  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 41]]). This could represent a phased escalation strategy, with China gradually increasing pressure. Another form of limited action involves intensifying gray zone activities, such as cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and economic coercion, aimed at destabilizing Taiwan internally and eroding its will to resist unification  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 15]]). China's approach involves exerting pressure on Taiwanese society in this ambiguous space between peace and war, seeking to achieve its objectives through non-military means as well  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 15]]).

A blockade of Taiwan, either partial or complete, represents a more significant escalation. Experts suggest this scenario might be more likely in the near term than a full-scale invasion  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). China could employ a combination of military assets, coast guard vessels, and maritime militia to restrict access to Taiwan's ports and airspace, effectively isolating the island and crippling its economy by disrupting trade and cutting off essential supplies like energy and food  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). Different types of blockade scenarios are conceivable, ranging from all-out kinetic blockades involving missile strikes and active interdiction to mining harbors and implementing limited blockades targeting specific goods  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]). China might also engage in extensive psychological operations during a blockade, potentially offering humanitarian corridors to Taiwanese citizens in an attempt to sow discord and undermine the government's authority  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]). Taiwan's relatively limited reserves of critical resources, such as coal, natural gas, and food stockpiles that reportedly last less than two months in some cases, make it particularly vulnerable to a prolonged blockade  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]).

The most extreme scenario is a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan. While China possesses numerical advantages in certain military assets, such an operation would be fraught with challenges and significant risks  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). Taiwan benefits from qualitative advantages in some military hardware and the inherent difficulties of conducting an amphibious assault against a well-defended island  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]). Some analysts predict that China could be militarily ready to attempt an invasion as early as 2025, while others point to the symbolic significance of the PLA's centennial in 2027 as a potential timeframe  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). In the event of an invasion, China might consider launching preemptive strikes against US military bases in the region, such as those in Guam, the Philippines, and Japan, thereby posing a direct threat to US military personnel  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). This would represent a major escalation with potentially devastating consequences.

**VII. The Cyber Dimension: A New Front in Cross-Strait Conflict:**

Cyber warfare has emerged as a critical domain in the context of a potential conflict between China and Taiwan. China has made substantial progress in developing its cyber warfare capabilities, viewing it not merely as a force multiplier but as a potential first-strike option and a strategic-level domain of conflict  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 46]]). Beijing considers cyber warfare an asymmetric tool that can help it overcome perceived disadvantages in conventional military hardware, aiming to achieve "information dominance"  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 47]]). The PLA has established specialized military network warfare forces, and China employs a "whole of nation" approach, leveraging the skills of civilian hackers and cybersecurity firms for state-sponsored cyber activities  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 49]]). A key focus of China's cyber strategy is targeting critical infrastructure, including power grids, water supplies, telecommunications networks, and financial institutions, with the potential to cause significant disruption and chaos  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 49]]).

Taiwan has been on the receiving end of a dramatic increase in cyberattacks, with the majority attributed to Chinese state-backed actors  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 42]]). In 2024, Taiwan experienced a doubling of cyberattacks compared to the previous year, with a staggering daily average of millions of attempts targeting government networks and critical industries such as telecommunications, transportation, and defense supply chains  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 55]]). These attacks employ a range of sophisticated techniques, including exploiting vulnerabilities in network devices, using social engineering tactics to target civil servants, and deploying Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks during periods of heightened military tension, such as during PLA military drills near the island  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 42]]). There are also reports of increasingly sophisticated methods, including the use of AI-driven phishing campaigns and supply chain attacks aimed at infiltrating Taiwanese networks undetected  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 53]]). China, in turn, has accused Taiwan of conducting cyberattacks and espionage against the mainland, indicating an ongoing and escalating cyber conflict between the two sides  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 52]]).

In the event of a military conflict, cyber warfare is likely to be an integral component of China's strategy. Cyberattacks could be used to cripple Taiwan's digital infrastructure, disrupt essential communications, and potentially disable early warning systems in the lead-up to or in conjunction with physical military actions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 46]]). There is also the potential for China to target undersea cables that provide Taiwan with vital internet connectivity, potentially leading to widespread blackouts and communication disruptions across the island  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 42]]). This could severely impact Taiwan's economy and its ability to seek and receive international assistance.

**VIII. The International Response: US Policy and Allied Involvement:**

The cornerstone of US policy towards Taiwan has been "strategic ambiguity," a deliberate stance of neither confirming nor denying whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). While the US has provided substantial military support to Taiwan, this ambiguity is intended to deter both China from attacking and Taiwan from unilaterally declaring independence. However, there is an ongoing debate within the US policy community regarding whether this long-standing policy should be replaced with "strategic clarity," a more explicit commitment to Taiwan's defense  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). The potential for a second Trump administration to further deviate from traditional US policy on Taiwan introduces a significant element of unpredictability, creating uncertainty for both Taipei and Beijing  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). Trump's past rhetoric and actions suggest a more transactional approach to foreign policy, which could lead to unexpected shifts in the US stance on Taiwan, potentially increasing the risk of miscalculation for all parties involved.

In the event of a Chinese military invasion or blockade of Taiwan, the international community would likely respond with strong condemnation and concerted diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a peaceful resolution  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). It is highly probable that the US and its allies would impose significant economic and diplomatic sanctions on China in an attempt to pressure Beijing to cease its aggression  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). While there appears to be bipartisan opposition within the US to deploying American ground troops to defend Taiwan, there is potentially greater support for using the US Navy to counter a Chinese blockade or for providing Taiwan with substantial military aid  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]). Key US allies in the region, particularly Japan and Australia, have also expressed increasing concern over China's growing assertiveness and might be willing to offer various forms of support to Taiwan or participate in a collective international response  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]).

The internal political climate within the US could significantly influence the nature and speed of its response to a crisis in the Taiwan Strait  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). A perception in Beijing that the US is distracted or weakened by domestic instability or political divisions could embolden China to act more decisively, potentially believing that the US response will be delayed, less forceful, or internally fractured  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). Internal divisions within the US government could also make it more challenging to forge a unified and robust response, potentially undermining the effectiveness of deterrence.

**IX. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in the Taiwan Strait:**

The analysis presented in this report underscores the escalating military pressure exerted by China on Taiwan, characterized by a significant increase in air and naval activities, the growing sophistication of its drone capabilities, and a clear pattern of using military exercises as a tool of coercive diplomacy. The potential for various escalation scenarios, ranging from limited gray zone tactics to a full-scale invasion, necessitates a careful and nuanced understanding of the factors influencing Beijing's strategic calculus.

The question of whether China might exploit a perceived window of opportunity created by US domestic considerations, such as presidential elections or periods of internal instability, is complex. While Beijing undoubtedly monitors the US political landscape for any signs of weakness or distraction, this is but one element in its multifaceted evaluation. China's decision-making process will also weigh its own military readiness, the potential for international intervention, the economic consequences of conflict, and the long-term implications for its regional and global standing.

The cyber dimension of a potential conflict cannot be overstated. China's growing cyber warfare capabilities and the persistent campaign of cyberattacks against Taiwan highlight the potential for this domain to play a decisive role in any future crisis, either as a precursor to or in conjunction with physical military actions.

Ultimately, maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait requires a clear understanding of the intricate interplay of these factors. International coordination, particularly between the US and its allies, and a consistent and credible US policy towards Taiwan are crucial for deterring Chinese aggression and ensuring peace in this strategically vital region. The evolving dynamics in the Taiwan Strait demand ongoing vigilance, robust strategic planning, and a commitment to maintaining a balance of power that discourages unilateral action and promotes peaceful resolution of differences.
