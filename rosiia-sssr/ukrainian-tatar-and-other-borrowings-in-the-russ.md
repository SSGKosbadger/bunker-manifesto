### Ukrainian, Tatar, and Other Borrowings in the Russian Language

Russians love to scream about their so-called "great and mighty" language, as if Noah himself handed it down from the heavens in a sacred ark. But if you dig a little into their linguistic dumpster, you’ll find that this "mighty" mix is more like shawarma: they grabbed everything within reach and slapped a "national treasure" label on it. Now they loudly insist that everything they have is "pure" and "original," while everyone else is "inferior." Well, let’s break it down and see what kind of **prison slang-infused pidgin** they’re actually speaking.

### Borrowed Ukrainian Words in Russian

- **"Praporshchik"** (from "prápor" – flag) – Because "Flagovshchik" would sound too ridiculous, like a rotten herring on a holiday table.
- **"Hrechka"** (from "hrechká" – buckwheat) – Not just a grain but a **symbol of survival** under every Russian regime.
- **"Hopak"** (from "hopák" – a Ukrainian dance) – If Russians danced hopak instead of marching to war, history would have been different.
- **"Borshch"** (from "borshch") – The **theft of the century**, so blatant that even their NKVD would have been jealous.
- **"Haidamak"** (from "haidamák" – Cossack rebel) – Once they cut down Russian invaders, now even the word itself makes Russians shudder.
- **"Horilka"** (from "horílka" – Ukrainian vodka) – They drink **tons of it**, but couldn't even come up with their own word.
- **"Khutir"** (from "khutir" – farmstead) – Once a symbol of **free Ukrainian life**, but in Russian, it just means a **dead-end village**.

### Borrowed Tatar Words in Russian

- **"Dengi"** (from Tatar *täñkä* – money) – Now it makes sense why their finances are always a mess – even the word isn’t theirs.
- **"Bashmak"** (from Tatar *bashmak* – shoe) – Shoes that **have seen more history than Russian textbooks**.
- **"Kazan"** (from Tatar *kazan* – cauldron) – Russians **cook their soups in it**, but **Tatars cooked up their history**.
- **"Chemodan"** (from Tatar *chamadan* – suitcase) – **The most popular Russian item since the introduction of sanctions.**

### Borrowed Words from Russian Criminal Slang (Fenya)

- **"Shmon"** (from "shmonat’" – to search, raid) – Not just an inspection, but an entire **F**ederal **S**ecurity **B**ureau lifestyle.
- **"Ksiva"** (from "ksivka" – document) – Because "udostovereniye" takes too long to pronounce, especially after **a vodka binge**.
- **"Balabol"** (from "balabolit’" – to babble) – **Strange that this isn’t an official title for Russian propagandists.**
- **"Fraer"** (from "frayer" – fool, outsider) – Exactly how Russians view anyone who refuses to **sign a contract with the army**.
- **"Shukher"** (from "shukher" – alarm, panic) – The **default** Russian government state **after every Ukrainian strike**.
- **"Loh"** (from Ukrainian "lokh" – fool) – The **most used** word in Russian politics because **it describes their electorate**.
- **"Tyrit’"** (from "tyrit’" – to steal) – The **number one economic strategy** in Russia.
- **"Malyava"** (from "malyava" – letter, prison note) – **Kremlin memos now write themselves automatically.**
- **"Ramsit’"** (from "ramsovat’" – to quarrel) – What Russians call **"geopolitics."**
- **"Stremno"** (from "stryomno" – dangerous, creepy) – The **only accurate description** of life in Russia.
- **"Mutit’"** (from "mutit’" – to scheme) – When **trillions are stolen, but it's somehow the West’s fault**.

### Russian Chauvinism – A Stillborn Idea

So, the next time some "great patriot" starts screeching about the "purity" of the Russian language, just hand them this list. And tell them that even **the word "bazaar" isn’t theirs.** If they still have arguments, challenge them to speak **without borrowed words** – and watch as they either fall silent or start stammering like **a dying Wi-Fi signal**.

Russia is a **zombie empire**, desperately clinging to the past but tumbling into the abyss of its own failure. And their language is a perfect reflection of this – **they have never created anything original.** Their history, culture, and even their swear words are **either stolen or poorly copied from others**. They **mock** Ukraine, Europe, and America, yet they are up to their necks in **Western gadgets, American sanctions, and French “menus.”**

So next time someone tells you that **"Russian is the greatest language,"** just remind them:  
**Even "samovar" comes from Asia.** 😆🔥
