# **The Looming Shadow of Returning Veterans: Ethnic Tensions and Potential Instability in Russia**

**1. Introduction: The Nexus of Returning Veterans and Ethnic Tensions in Russia.**

The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War has had a profound impact on the Russian Federation, extending beyond the battlefield to its internal social and political landscape. As the conflict continues and veterans begin to return home, a complex interplay of factors suggests a growing potential for the escalation of ethnic conflicts within Russia. This report examines this critical issue, focusing on how the return of military personnel, particularly those recruited from economically depressed and ethnically diverse regions, could exacerbate existing socio-economic inequalities and historical tensions, thereby increasing the risk of internal instability. By analyzing the ethnic composition of the Russian military involved in the conflict, the socio-economic conditions prevalent in regions with significant veteran populations, the historical and contemporary landscape of ethnic tensions, the potential impact of returning veterans on interethnic relations, documented instances of rising ethnic hostility, the policies of the Russian government concerning national minorities and veteran support, and expert forecasts for future scenarios, this report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of this multifaceted challenge. The central argument posits that the confluence of these factors creates a significant potential for escalating ethnic conflicts within Russia, demanding careful consideration from policymakers and analysts alike. The subsequent sections will delve into each of these aspects in detail, providing a nuanced analysis of the potential for internal upheaval within the Russian Federation.

**2. Disproportionate Ethnic Representation in the Russian Military: A Historical and Contemporary Analysis.**

Research indicates a significant disparity in the ethnic representation within the Russian military casualties of the war in Ukraine. Data reveals that ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples are suffering disproportionately high fatality rates compared to their share of the overall Russian population  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). For instance, the Buryat people, a Mongolic ethnic group native to southeastern Siberia, account for 1.16% of identified Russian casualties, despite comprising only 0.3% of Russia's total population  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). Similarly, Chukchis and other small indigenous groups from the easternmost Chukotka autonomous region constitute 0.09% of war casualties, while their total population is less than 0.01% of the country's populace  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). This overrepresentation is not limited to these groups; Tyvans, Kalmyks, and Nenets peoples also feature prominently among the casualties relative to their population size  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). This pattern suggests that certain ethnic groups are either being targeted for frontline deployment or are enlisting at higher rates, possibly due to socio-economic factors prevalent in their regions of origin  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). Activists and researchers have voiced concerns that the Kremlin might be exploiting the country's non-Slavic population as "cannon fodder" in its military endeavors  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). The sheer scale of losses among some of the smaller indigenous communities raises serious concerns about their long-term demographic survival  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]).

This overrepresentation of ethnic minorities in the Russian military is not a recent development. Historically, non-Russians have likely constituted a larger share of the Russian Armed Forces than their proportion in the general population  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]). This trend has been attributed to both historical recruitment patterns and contemporary socio-economic factors that make military service a more attractive option for individuals from certain regions and ethnic backgrounds  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]). Data from 2017 indicated that a majority of the Russian Army's officer corps (53%) and an even larger percentage of sergeants (64%) were ethnic Ukrainians and members of Caucasus nationalities, respectively, with ethnic Russians forming a minority in these key military ranks  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]). While the proportion of Ukrainians might have shifted since 2022, the significant representation of Caucasus nationalities remains noteworthy given the complex history and ongoing tensions in that region  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]). Historical analysis of the Soviet military also reveals a long-standing practice of managing ethnic diversity within its ranks, sometimes through the segregation of Slavic and non-Slavic troops and the strategic deployment of non-Slavs in support roles or construction battalions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 11]]). This historical context of differential treatment and occasional exploitation of ethnic animosities within the military could have lasting implications for interethnic relations in the broader society  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 12]]).

Contemporary recruitment efforts for the war in Ukraine appear to be deliberately targeting ethnic minorities and individuals from economically depressed regions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 13]]). Reports indicate active campaigns in regions beyond Moscow and St. Petersburg, often home to significant ethnic minority populations, with advertisements sometimes specifically targeting these groups in their native languages  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 15]]). Financial incentives, including relatively high salaries and the promise of Russian passports for foreign fighters and migrants, are being used to attract recruits  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 13]]). This targeted recruitment, particularly of vulnerable populations like migrants and those in economically precarious situations, could exacerbate existing social inequalities and breed resentment if promises are not fulfilled or if these individuals face discrimination  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). The reliance on financial incentives also suggests a potential difficulty in recruiting from more affluent ethnic Russian regions, further skewing the ethnic composition of the forces engaged in the conflict  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 14]]). The disproportionate number of soldiers from regions like Buryatia and Tuva underscores this trend of targeted recruitment from specific ethnic minority areas  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]).

**3. Socio-Economic Vulnerabilities in Veteran-Origin Regions: Fueling Potential Discontent.**

The socio-economic conditions in regions that have contributed a significant number of soldiers to the conflict, such as Buryatia and Tuva, are characterized by economic hardship and limited opportunities. Buryatia, while possessing a well-developed transport infrastructure and natural resources, relies heavily on federal financial support and faces challenges in its energy sector  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 19]]). Despite historical periods of higher growth, the region's industrial output growth has lagged behind other parts of Russia  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 20]]). The agro-industrial complex forms a significant part of its economy, but it faces issues like decreased domestic production and competition from imports  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 19]]). The lack of investment in integrated transport and logistics also hinders economic growth  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 19]]). These vulnerabilities suggest that returning veterans might face a challenging economic landscape with limited job prospects.

Tuva consistently exhibits one of the highest unemployment rates in Russia  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 21]]). In 2010, the unemployment rate in Tuva reached over 21%, significantly exceeding the national average  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 21]]). Even in later years, such as 2019 and 2020, Tuva's unemployment rate remained among the highest in the country, reaching 12.3% and 18% respectively  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 22]]). The region's economy is largely focused on agriculture and mining, which might not provide sufficient employment opportunities for returning veterans with military skills and experiences  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 23]]). This high level of unemployment makes the financial incentives of military contracts particularly attractive for residents of Tuva, but it also implies that veterans returning to the republic will likely encounter significant difficulties in securing stable civilian employment.

Dagestan presents a different set of socio-economic challenges, marked by significant social inequality  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]). Unemployment is a major issue in Dagestan, with rates consistently higher than the Russian average  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]). Economic inequality is also pronounced, with the republic being one of the poorest regions in the Russian Federation  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 27]]). Corruption is reportedly widespread, and the distribution of power and resources often follows ethnic lines due to a system of ethnic quotas in government  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]). This complex interplay of ethnic identity and socio-economic factors could lead to heightened tensions if returning veterans from different ethnic groups perceive unequal access to limited opportunities.

Ethnic segregation, both historically and currently, also plays a role in the socio-economic landscape of these regions. In the Soviet era, there were deliberate policies of segregating servicemen and stationing them away from their home regions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 11]]). While the military units today are ethnically mixed  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 11]]), societal ethnic segregation persists, particularly in regions like Dagestan where different ethnic groups tend to live in distinct settlements, especially in rural areas  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 29]]). This segregation could complicate the reintegration of veterans from diverse backgrounds and might foster competition along ethnic lines for scarce resources and employment opportunities.

The broader economic conditions in Russia, heavily influenced by the war in Ukraine, have created a situation where military service offers significantly higher pay compared to civilian jobs in many of these recruitment regions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]). This disparity could lead to disillusionment among veterans returning to lower-paying civilian life, potentially contributing to social unrest and even criminal activity as they struggle to maintain their previous income levels  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). Furthermore, veterans often face challenges in finding employment after military service, as evidenced by studies from other countries like the US and Ukraine  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 41]]). This suggests that Russian veterans returning to regions with pre-existing socio-economic vulnerabilities are likely to encounter significant unemployment issues, which could further fuel social and ethnic tensions.

**4. A Legacy of Ethnic Conflicts and Tensions within Russia: Setting the Stage.**

The regions from which a significant number of veterans are returning have a history marked by ethnic conflicts and tensions, which could be reignited or exacerbated by the current situation. Buryatia, for instance, witnessed the 1929 Buryat Revolt, a poorly organized uprising against the Soviet policy of forced collectivization and discrimination against the Buryat people, who primarily adhered to Buddhism  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 46]]). The revolt, triggered by Stalin's collectivization strategy and preceding years of persecution of Buryat culture and religion, resulted in the deaths of approximately 35,000 Buryats and had a lasting impact on the community and Soviet ethnic policies  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 46]]). This historical resistance against the central government, rooted in ethnic and religious identity, could resonate with current grievances related to disproportionate war losses and socio-economic hardships.

Tuva also has a history of interethnic strife, particularly between the indigenous Tuvans and ethnic Russians  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]). Following Tuva's declaration of sovereignty in the early 1990s, the republic experienced severe inter-ethnic tension, including violence against Russians and a subsequent mass migration of the Russian-speaking population  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 48]]). While the acute phase of this conflict has passed, underlying tensions persist due to socio-economic disparities, with Tuvans generally experiencing a lower standard of living compared to immigrants, primarily due to educational differences  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 51]]). The ongoing war in Ukraine has reportedly led to ethnic conflicts within the ranks of the Russian army between Tuvans and ethnic Russians, often involving violence and even fatalities, stemming from issues like the perceived superiority of Russians and competition for military equipment  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]). Returning Tuvinian veterans who have experienced or witnessed such conflicts might carry these tensions back to their communities.

Dagestan's history is characterized by a complex tapestry of ethnic diversity and a long history of both internal and external conflicts  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). The republic is home to over 30 indigenous ethnic groups, each with its own language and distinct cultural identity  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]). The 1999 war in Dagestan, triggered by an invasion of Chechen-based Islamic militants, highlighted the region's vulnerability to external influences and the complex interplay between ethnic and religious factors in conflict  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]). Even before this, tensions existed between various ethnic groups over land, resources, and political power, often managed through a Soviet-era system of ethnic quotas in government  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]). Current tensions persist, particularly concerning land disputes, such as those between Chechens and other ethnic groups over resettlement in areas they inhabited before their deportation in 1944  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 10]]). The return of veterans from Dagestan, who might have fought alongside or against individuals from different ethnic backgrounds, including those from neighboring Chechnya, could further strain the already delicate interethnic balance in the republic.

Beyond these specific regions, Russia as a whole has a long history of ethnic tensions and conflicts, dating back to the Soviet era and even earlier  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 53]]). These tensions have arisen from a multitude of factors, including the legacy of Soviet nationalities policies that sometimes exacerbated ethnic differences  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 60]]), economic disparities between regions and ethnic groups  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 54]]), territorial disputes and arbitrarily drawn borders  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 56]]), and cultural and linguistic differences  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 54]]). The ongoing war in Ukraine appears to be exacerbating these underlying tensions, contributing to a rise in xenophobia and interethnic hostility across the country  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 55]]). This historical and contemporary landscape of ethnic friction provides a volatile backdrop against which the return of veterans could potentially ignite or amplify existing conflicts.

**5. The Impact of Returning Veterans on Russia's Social Fabric: A Focus on Interethnic Dynamics.**

The return of veterans from the Russo-Ukrainian War poses significant challenges to Russia's social fabric, particularly in the realm of interethnic relations. Many veterans will face difficulties reintegrating into civilian life, struggling with psychological trauma such as PTSD, finding stable employment, and experiencing social alienation  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). The historical precedent of "Afghan Syndrome" following the Soviet-Afghan War, characterized by veterans' disillusionment and difficulties in reintegration, suggests a potential for similar challenges on a potentially larger scale given the greater number of veterans returning from Ukraine  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). This situation is further compounded by the recruitment of prisoners with violent pasts, who may struggle even more with reintegration and could contribute to a rise in crime  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]).

The pattern of military recruitment, which has disproportionately drawn soldiers from non-Russian republics and economically disadvantaged regions, means that crime committed by returning veterans could take on an ethnic dimension  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). If certain ethnic groups are perceived to be overrepresented in veteran-related criminal activities due to these recruitment patterns, it could fuel ethnic prejudice and generate negative responses from the population, potentially setting the stage for interethnic conflicts  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). The economic hardships faced by many veterans upon their return, especially in regions with limited job opportunities, could also lead some to turn to crime for additional income, further exacerbating social tensions that might be interpreted along ethnic lines  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]).

Veterans with combat experience might also be more inclined to use violence in resolving conflicts in their civilian lives, including disputes that could arise between different ethnic groups  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). The experience of war can normalize violence and make veterans more prone to resorting to it. The potential for veterans to have access to weapons, either legally or illegally, could also escalate interethnic clashes  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). Furthermore, veterans who feel neglected by the government or society might become socially and politically alienated, potentially leading to anti-government sentiment and involvement in protests or other forms of social unrest  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). If these feelings of neglect are shared within specific ethnic communities, it could lead to collective action along ethnic lines, potentially increasing interethnic tensions or even fueling separatist sentiments.

**6. Evidence of Escalating Ethnic Hostility: Tracing Connections to Veteran Returns and Socio-Economic Factors.**

There is growing evidence of escalating ethnic hostility within Russia, with potential links to the return of veterans and underlying socio-economic factors. Following events such as the Moscow terrorist attack, a rise in xenophobia and hate crimes has been observed, particularly targeting Central Asian migrants and individuals perceived as non-Slavic  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 17]]). This reflects a broader trend of intolerance towards certain ethnic groups, which could be further inflamed by the return of veterans who may have been exposed to nationalist narratives during the war or who themselves face difficulties reintegrating and might project their frustrations onto minority groups  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 55]]).

Reports have also emerged of ethnic clashes directly involving veterans. Conflicts within the Russian army between soldiers from different ethnic groups, such as Tuvans and ethnic Russians, have been documented  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]). These clashes, often stemming from issues of perceived superiority and competition for resources, indicate existing ethnic tensions within the military that could potentially spill over into civilian life as veterans return to their communities  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]). The case of a Russian soldier reportedly beaten by fellow servicemen upon returning home due to ethnic strife highlights this risk  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 87]]).

Socio-economic factors continue to play a significant role in fueling ethnic hostility. Economic hardship, including unemployment and poverty, can exacerbate existing prejudices and lead to the scapegoating of ethnic minorities, who may be perceived as competitors for scarce resources  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 54]]). In regions with high veteran populations that also suffer from economic instability, the return of veterans facing unemployment could intensify interethnic competition for jobs and resources, potentially leading to increased tensions and conflict  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 54]]).

Reports also suggest a rise in veteran-related crime, although the direct link to ethnic motivations is not always clear  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]). However, in the context of rising xenophobia and existing ethnic prejudices, the increased incidence of crime involving veterans could be interpreted through an ethnic lens, further contributing to interethnic hostility and distrust. The readiness of some veteran organizations to resist "ethnocriminality"  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]) also indicates a potential for returning veterans to become involved in vigilante actions or interethnic confrontations.

**7. Russian Government Policies on Nationalities and Veteran Support: Managing a Complex Landscape.**

The Russian government's stated policy on interethnic relations emphasizes the principles of equality and the prevention of discrimination based on ethnicity, race, language, or religion  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 97]]). The Strategy for the Russian Federation State Ethnic Policy towards 2025 aims to strengthen a unified civic identity while preserving the ethnocultural diversity of the nation  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 97]]). Various legal frameworks and government bodies are in place to address issues of interethnic harmony and to counter extremism and discrimination  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 97]]).

However, evidence suggests a gap between these stated policies and the realities on the ground. Reports of ethnic discrimination in government contracts, favoring individuals of "Slavic appearance" for certain positions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 99]]), contradict the official commitment to equality. Historically, the Soviet policy of "korenizatsiia" aimed to integrate non-Russian nationalities  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 100]]), but under the current Russian Federation, there has been a trend towards centralizing power and promoting a unified educational space, potentially at the expense of minority language and cultural preservation  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 102]]). This shift could be perceived by ethnic minorities as an erosion of their rights and cultural autonomy.

The Russian government has also implemented various programs to support veterans returning from the war in Ukraine, including financial assistance, job training schemes, and initiatives to integrate veterans into government and political structures  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 80]]). The narrative promoted by the Kremlin often portrays these veterans as a "new elite" who should play a leading role in governing the country  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 89]]). However, analysts suggest that these programs may also serve as a tool for the Kremlin to maintain control over veterans and prevent the emergence of independent civil society groups that could challenge the regime  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 71]]). If the support provided is perceived as being unevenly distributed across ethnic groups or if veterans feel they are being used for political purposes, it could further exacerbate ethnic tensions and resentment.

While the Russian government has established legal mechanisms to prevent ethnic conflict and extremism  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 89]]), the observed rise in xenophobia and ethnic tensions suggests that these measures might not be fully effective. The government's focus on suppressing dissent and restricting political freedoms  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 111]]) could also hinder open dialogue and the peaceful resolution of ethnic grievances.

**8. Potential Scenarios for Internal Instability: Projecting Future Trajectories.**

Several potential scenarios could lead to internal instability within Russia, exacerbated by the return of veterans and existing ethnic tensions. An economic crisis, fueled by the ongoing war, international sanctions, and underlying demographic challenges, could lead to increased unemployment and a decline in living standards  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 114]]). This economic hardship could disproportionately affect regions with high veteran populations and significant ethnic minority groups, potentially triggering social unrest along ethnic lines, especially if veterans feel that their sacrifices have not been rewarded and that they are facing discrimination in the job market and society.

The war in Ukraine and the perceived weakening of the central government could also embolden existing separatist sentiments in various ethnic republics and regions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 51]]). The return of veterans, particularly those from ethnic minority groups who may feel alienated or disenfranchised, could provide these movements with experienced leadership and organizational capacity, potentially leading to increased calls for autonomy or even independence.

A particularly concerning scenario is the potential for widespread interethnic clashes and an "ethnic explosion"  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]). This could be fueled by a combination of factors, including the disproportionate casualties suffered by ethnic minorities in the war  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]), rising xenophobia and hate crimes targeting non-Slavic populations  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 17]]), the return of veterans with combat experience and potential psychological trauma who might be more prone to violence  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]), and the exploitation of existing ethnic grievances by both internal and external actors  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 127]]).

The convergence of these factors could lead to broader regional instability and civil unrest, potentially exceeding the scale of previous internal conflicts  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). The return of a large number of veterans to regions already grappling with socio-economic problems and ethnic tensions could create a highly volatile environment where localized conflicts could escalate and spread, especially given the potential for a weakened security apparatus in some regions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]).

**9. Expert Assessments and Forecasts: Evaluating the Likelihood and Scale of Ethnic Unrest.**

Expert analysis suggests a significant level of concern regarding Russia's internal stability in the context of returning veterans and ethnic tensions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 71]]). Some experts foresee a potential for ethnic conflicts that could be more devastating than those experienced in Europe  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 136]]). The Kremlin itself has acknowledged the challenges faced by returning veterans in adapting to civilian life and the potential for increased crime  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 36]]).

However, expert opinions are not uniform. Some analysts believe that while ethnic tensions will likely rise, the Russian government's repressive capabilities will likely prevent them from escalating into widespread instability  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 87]]). Others point to the resilience of the Russian economy as a factor that might mitigate immediate social unrest  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 122]]). The apparent stability of public support for the war, often referred to as the "Putin consensus,"  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 137]]) is also cited as a factor that could limit the potential for widespread dissent. Nevertheless, even those who see current stability acknowledge the existence of long-term challenges and uncertainties surrounding the regime's ability to effectively address the complex issues at hand  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 138]]).

Key indicators that could signal an escalation of ethnic tensions and internal instability include a noticeable increase in reported incidents of interethnic violence, a surge in the activity and visibility of separatist movements, a significant decline in socio-economic conditions specifically within ethnic minority regions, and marked changes in the Russian government's policies or rhetoric concerning national minorities. The level of organization and public expression of grievances by returning veterans, particularly those from ethnic minority backgrounds, will also be a crucial factor to monitor. The ability of the government to effectively address the socio-economic and psychological needs of these veterans will likely play a significant role in shaping the future trajectory of internal stability within Russia.

**10. Conclusion and Recommendations: Mitigating the Risks of Ethnic Conflict in Russia.**

In conclusion, the return of veterans from the Russo-Ukrainian War to a Russia grappling with socio-economic vulnerabilities and a history of ethnic tensions creates a significant potential for escalating ethnic conflicts and internal instability. The disproportionate representation of ethnic minorities in the military casualties, coupled with targeted recruitment from economically depressed regions, has likely sown seeds of resentment within these communities. The challenges of veteran reintegration, including psychological trauma and unemployment, are compounded by existing ethnic prejudices and rising xenophobia within Russian society. While the Russian government has stated policies aimed at promoting interethnic harmony and supporting veterans, the evidence suggests that discriminatory practices persist, and the effectiveness of current measures in preventing conflict remains questionable. Expert assessments indicate a considerable level of concern about the potential for internal instability, with some forecasting a risk of significant ethnic conflict.

To mitigate these risks, the Russian government should prioritize the implementation of comprehensive and culturally sensitive veteran reintegration programs that specifically address the psychological, economic, and social needs of veterans from all ethnic backgrounds. Targeted economic development initiatives in regions with high military recruitment are crucial to address underlying socio-economic inequalities. Upholding and rigorously enforcing anti-discrimination laws, alongside proactive measures to combat xenophobia and ethnic prejudice, is essential. Fostering genuine dialogue and engagement with ethnic minority communities, respecting their cultural and linguistic rights, is paramount to addressing grievances and building trust. Ensuring fairness and equity in military recruitment and service, and thoroughly investigating any allegations of discriminatory practices, will also be critical.

International actors should support independent monitoring of human rights and ethnic relations within Russia, and where possible, provide assistance to organizations working on veteran support and interethnic reconciliation. Condemning all forms of ethnic discrimination and violence and considering the potential for internal instability in Russia when formulating foreign policy strategies are also important steps. Addressing these complex and interconnected issues proactively is vital to preventing a potentially destabilizing scenario within the Russian Federation and its surrounding regions.
