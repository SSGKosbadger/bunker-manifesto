# **Analysis of Public Affiliations of Organizers and Supporters of "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" Protests**

**I. Introduction**

This report examines the public statements, affiliations, and past positions held by organizers and prominent supporters of the "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" protests to determine if any evidence suggests prior employment in US government institutions or national security agencies. The analysis relies on open-source profiles, media interviews, and professional biographies to identify potential connections. The "50501" movement organized nationwide demonstrations in opposition to the policies and actions of the second Donald Trump administration in the United States. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) These protests addressed a range of concerns, including government efficiency cuts, the rescinding of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and the influence of figures like Elon Musk. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]) The "Tesla Takedown" movement specifically targeted Elon Musk and his role as head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Trump, focusing on economic pressure against Musk through boycotts of Tesla products and stock. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]) This analysis seeks to shed light on the backgrounds of key individuals involved in these protests to understand potential influences and affiliations.

**II. Background on the Protests**

The "50501" protests emerged as a response to the policies and actions of the Trump administration, with the name representing "50 protests, 50 states, one movement". ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Discussions about a nationwide protest began on social media in late 2024, originating from a Reddit post and quickly gaining traction. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) The movement's first nationwide demonstration occurred on February 5, 2025, followed by another on Presidents' Day, February 17, themed "No Kings on Presidents Day," and a third on March 4, 2025. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) These protests saw participation from a diverse array of individuals and organizations, including established groups like MoveOn and Indivisible, as well as more recent web-based upstarts. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]) The rapid spread of the movement and the involvement of such organizations indicate a unifying effect, providing a platform for various grievances against the administration. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]) The movement's focus extended beyond general anti-Trump sentiment to specific policy concerns, encompassing government efficiency cuts leading to layoffs, the rescinding of DEI initiatives, and the perceived undue influence of figures like Elon Musk within the federal system. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Protesters also voiced concerns about the working class being exploited by the "billionaire class" in the Oval Office. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]])

The "Tesla Takedown" movement originated specifically in response to Elon Musk's increased role in the US government under President Donald Trump, particularly his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the resulting federal spending cuts and agency shutdowns. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]) The movement's primary objective was to economically harm Elon Musk through coordinated action against his company, Tesla, with the ultimate aim of impacting his political influence and potentially forcing him out of his government position. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]) This effort involved various groups of supporters, including disillusioned Tesla owners, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and Democratic Party lawmakers like Rep. Jasmine Crockett and Rep. Pramila Jayapal. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]) Tactics employed by the movement included calls for Tesla owners to sell their vehicles and for the public to divest from Tesla stock, aiming to depress the company's stock price. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 13]]) Organizers consistently emphasized the peaceful nature of these protests, especially in light of several incidents of vandalism and arson targeting Tesla showrooms and vehicles, which were condemned by both Elon Musk and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 15]]) The "Tesla Takedown" movement's strategy was clearly focused on Elon Musk's governmental role as the head of DOGE, utilizing economic pressure on his main company, Tesla, as the most direct way to influence his political involvement. Furthermore, the active participation and endorsement of the movement by prominent figures from the entertainment industry and the US Congress significantly amplified its visibility and provided a degree of legitimacy within certain political circles. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]])

This investigation focuses on identifying any public statements, affiliations, or past positions that suggest prior employment in US government institutions or national security agencies for the organizers and prominent supporters of both the "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" protests. The analysis relies primarily on open-source profiles, media interviews, and professional bios to gather this information.

**III. Analysis of "50501" Protest Organizers and Supporters**

Kay Evert was identified as an organizer for the "50501" protests. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) One source mentioned Geri Peterson as the lead organizer in Vermont for 50501, suggesting a potential national or coordinating role for individuals named Kay Evert. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 10]]) Open-source searches for "Kay Evert" revealed several individuals with diverse professional backgrounds. One Kay Everett is listed as an Assistant Professor at Tufts University in Biomedical Engineering and Medicine  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 20]]), indicating a career in academia and medical research. Another Kay Everett is identified as an IT Clinical Applications Manager for Epic at Greater Baltimore Medical Center since 1999, with a history in healthcare IT management. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 21]]) The name also appears in connection with "Everytown," a gun violence prevention organization  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 22]]), and the International Handball Federation (IHF) website, likely a sports figure. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 23]]) An obituary mentions a Jeffrey Allen Kay with a nephew Glenna Kay (Evert Eklund)  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 24]]), suggesting a family connection. A news article reported the passing of Kay McDaniel, a former LSU tennis player. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 25]]) A deceased Detroit City Councilmember named Kay Everett was also found. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 26]]) Additionally, Kathryn S. (Kay) Ebert, the second vice president of the International Chapter of the P.E.O., with a career in employee safety and health, was identified. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 27]]) The Kay Everett Memorial Lecture at SOAS University of London commemorates a law firm partner specializing in immigration law. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 28]]) Finally, a Kay Evert described their activism and organizational efforts against a "fascist system". ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 29]]) Given the variety of professions associated with the name "Kay Evert," it is challenging to pinpoint the specific individual involved in organizing the protests. However, none of the available information directly suggests prior employment in US federal government institutions or national security agencies for any of these individuals.

Sydney Wilson was identified as a prominent supporter and national press liaison for the "50501" movement. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]) Research into Sydney Wilson's background revealed several individuals. One Sydney Wilson is the Senior Vice President of Sales at Tambourine, a hospitality marketing company. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 30]]) Another Sydney Wilson played tennis at Cal State Northridge. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]) A SYDNEY WILSON works as a Media Specialist at an elementary school in North Carolina. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]) An obituary was found for a Sydney Wilson who worked in advertising and real estate operations. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]) The Wilson Leadership Fellows program is named after Samuel V. Wilson, a former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]) The Sidney Wilson House in Washington is a housing facility. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 36]]) A news report discussed a Sydney Wilson involved in an incident with law enforcement. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 37]]) Notably, a profile on a military website features a Sidney Wilson (spelling with an 'i') as a Petty Officer Second Class in the US Navy, working as a damage controlman. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 38]]) This indicates current or prior employment within a US government institution (the Navy). While the spelling differs slightly, it is plausible this is the same Sydney Wilson who served as a national press liaison for the "50501" protests. Wilson Security is an Australian company  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 39]]) and is likely unrelated. The existence of a Sidney Wilson with a confirmed military background suggests a potential link to a US government institution for at least one prominent supporter of the "50501" protest.

"Potus Black" was identified as a leader of the D.C. chapter of the "50501" Movement. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 41]]) The moniker "Potus Black" is likely an online handle, with "Potus" being a common abbreviation for "President of the United States". ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 42]]) The addition of "Black" likely refers to the individual's racial identity or could be a symbolic reference. This makes it difficult to find real-world professional information using this name alone. The provided snippets do not reveal any professional background for "Potus Black," nor do they suggest any connections to US government institutions or national security agencies. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 43]])

**IV. Analysis of "Tesla Takedown" Protest Organizers and Supporters**

Alex Winter was identified as a supporter who amplified the "Tesla Takedown" protests  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]) and is focused on "taking down Tesla". ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 46]]) Open-source information confirms that this Alex Winter is the well-known actor and filmmaker. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 47]]) His professional biography includes prominent roles in the "Bill & Ted" franchise and "The Lost Boys," as well as directing documentaries on technology and social issues. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 47]]) Media interviews reveal his long-standing interest in the internet, online communities, and the societal impacts of technology. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 49]]) While other individuals named Alex Winter exist in fields like energy services, software sales, and commercial real estate  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 58]]), the context clearly points to the actor/filmmaker. There is no evidence in the provided snippets to suggest that this Alex Winter has any prior or current employment in US government institutions or national security agencies.

Joan Donovan was identified as a key organizer of the "Tesla Takedown" movement  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 13]]) and an online activist who influenced Alex Winter's involvement. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]) Research shows Joan Donovan is a prominent American social science researcher, sociologist, and academic specializing in disinformation. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 61]]) She is currently an assistant professor at Boston University and the founder of the Critical Internet Studies Institute (CISI). ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 61]]) Previously, she held positions at Harvard Kennedy School and Data & Society. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 61]]) Her research focuses on media manipulation, online extremism, and disinformation campaigns, as discussed in numerous media interviews. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 63]]) Notably, snippets indicate that Joan Donovan "discusses the implications of her research" with US government defense agencies such as DARPA, the DOD, and ISAT. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 71]]) She is also a guest author for "Just Security," writing on topics related to national security. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 72]]) While her expertise is relevant to and sought after by government entities, there is no direct evidence of prior employment within these institutions; her role appears to be that of an academic expert and researcher.

John Cusack was identified as a celebrity supporter of the "Tesla Takedown" movement. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]) Open-source information confirms this is the actor John Cusack, known for his extensive filmography. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 48]]) Reports also detail his activity and opinions on social media. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 73]]) Other individuals named John Cusack exist, including a partner at a law firm and a financial crime compliance expert  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 75]]), as well as someone in real estate. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 77]]) However, the context of celebrity involvement clearly points to the actor. There is no information in the provided snippets to suggest that the actor John Cusack has any prior or current employment in US government institutions or national security agencies.

Jasmine Crockett was identified as a prominent supporter of the "Tesla Takedown" movement, a Democratic Party lawmaker and U.S. Representative for Texas's 30th congressional district. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]) Her current position as a US Representative directly constitutes employment within a US government institution (the legislative branch). ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 78]]) Prior to her federal service, Crockett worked as a public defender for Bowie County, Texas (a local government role), and served in the Texas House of Representatives (state government). ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 80]]) She also practiced law in a private firm, focusing on criminal defense and civil rights. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 80]]) There is no information in the snippets to suggest any background in US national security agencies.

Pramila Jayapal was identified as another Democratic lawmaker, a U.S. Representative from Seattle, who supported the "Tesla Takedown" protests. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]) Her current role as a US Representative for Washington's 7th District is employment within a US government institution (the legislative branch). ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 79]]) Before serving in the US House, Jayapal was a Washington State Senator from 2014 to 2016, indicating prior government employment at the state level. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 85]]) Her professional background also includes working in global public health and development, founding an immigrant advocacy organization, and working in finance. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 79]]) There is no information in the provided snippets suggesting any background in US national security agencies.

**Table 2: "Tesla Takedown" Protest Organizers and Supporters - Potential Government/National Security Connections**

**V. Cross-Protest Analysis**

Based on the information available in the provided snippets, there is no explicit overlap in the identified key organizers or prominent supporters between the "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" protests. While both movements share opposition to Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the individuals highlighted as leading or supporting each appear distinct. Kay Evert, Sydney Wilson, and Potus Black, associated with "50501," are not mentioned in the context of "Tesla Takedown." Conversely, Alex Winter, Joan Donovan, and John Cusack, linked to "Tesla Takedown," are not identified as organizers or supporters of "50501" in this research material. U.S. Representatives Jasmine Crockett and Pramila Jayapal supported the "Tesla Takedown" movement as elected officials, but their involvement with the "50501" protests is not evident in the provided snippets. This suggests that while shared sentiments may exist, the core leadership and publicly identified supporters seem different for each protest.

**VI. Discussion of Findings**

The analysis reveals that U.S. Representatives Jasmine Crockett and Pramila Jayapal, both prominent supporters of the "Tesla Takedown" protests, currently hold positions in the US federal government as members of the House of Representatives. Jasmine Crockett also has a history of government service at the state and local levels, including her work as a public defender and her term in the Texas House of Representatives. Similarly, Pramila Jayapal previously served as a Washington State Senator. A significant finding is the potential military background of Sydney Wilson, a national press liaison for the "50501" protests, who appears to be a Petty Officer Second Class in the US Navy. This indicates a direct connection to a US government institution (the military). For Kay Evert and Potus Black (associated with "50501"), and Alex Winter, Joan Donovan, and John Cusack (associated with "Tesla Takedown"), no direct evidence of prior or current employment in US federal government institutions or national security agencies was found within the provided open-source data. It is important to acknowledge the limitations of relying solely on open-source information. This analysis provides an initial assessment but may not capture all relevant connections, especially if individuals have not publicly disclosed such information. Additionally, individuals might have had interactions with government or national security entities in capacities other than direct employment. For instance, Joan Donovan's expertise on disinformation has led to discussions with defense agencies, indicating a professional relationship. The nature of both protests, being critical of the current administration, might influence the willingness of individuals with prior government or national security backgrounds to publicly associate with them.

**VII. Conclusion**

Based on the analysis of the provided open-source information, the key organizers and prominent supporters of the "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" protests primarily consist of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including academia, entertainment, activism, and elected office. While U.S. Representatives Jasmine Crockett and Pramila Jayapal have clear and current ties to the US government, and Sydney Wilson potentially has a military background, the other key figures identified show no direct connections to US government institutions or national security agencies in their publicly available information. These findings suggest that the primary drivers behind these protest movements are likely grassroots activism, public opposition to specific political figures and policies, and concerns about the direction of the government. However, the potential military background of a key supporter for the "50501" movement warrants further investigation if more identifying information becomes available.
