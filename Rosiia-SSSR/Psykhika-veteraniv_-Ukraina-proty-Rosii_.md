# **A Comparative Analysis of the Mental Health and Criminal Behavior of Ukrainian and Russian Veterans Post-Demobilization**

**1. Introduction:**

The psychological aftermath of armed conflict on military personnel constitutes a significant and enduring global challenge. Modern warfare, characterized by its intense and often protracted nature, frequently leaves indelible marks on the mental well-being of those who participate. The ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia provides a critical context for examining these consequences. The extensive scale and prolonged duration of hostilities are anticipated to result in a substantial number of veterans on both sides facing considerable psychosocial difficulties upon their return to civilian life.

This report will conduct an in-depth analysis of the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the occurrence of criminal activity among Ukrainian and Russian veterans following the cessation of their military service. It will compare the available data for both groups, highlighting key distinctions and similarities. Furthermore, this analysis will explore the influence of various factors that can shape the mental health and reintegration trajectories of veterans. These factors include the availability and efficacy of social support networks, the scope and impact of governmental rehabilitation initiatives, the perceptions and attitudes of society towards veterans, and the specific characteristics of the combat experiences encountered by soldiers from each nation. The subsequent sections of this report will systematically examine the prevalence of PTSD, the rates of criminal activity, the factors contributing to observed differences, and a detailed comparison of the psychological assistance and rehabilitation programs accessible in Ukraine and Russia. The concluding section will synthesize the principal findings and discuss their broader implications.

**2. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in Veterans:**

- **2.1. PTSD Among Ukrainian Veterans:**
    - **Pre-February 2022 Context:** Even before the full-scale invasion in February 2022, PTSD was an increasing concern among Ukrainian veterans who had served in the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, known as the Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) and later the Joint Forces Operation (JFO). Approximately 80% of military personnel involved in these combat operations experienced combat stress, with around 25% subsequently developing PTSD of varying severity  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). A considerable proportion, between 20% and 30%, required external psychological assistance to address their psychological imbalance, yet the issue of PTSD in Ukraine was not adequately addressed prior to February 2022  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). The protracted conflict in Eastern Ukraine since 2014 had already created a significant cohort of veterans grappling with PTSD, indicating a pre-existing mental health challenge that has likely been intensified by the full-scale invasion. The continuous exposure to hostilities over an extended period before 2022 likely increased the cumulative trauma experienced by Ukrainian soldiers. The identified 25% PTSD rate within this group before the major escalation signifies a substantial baseline of mental health needs. Moreover, the acknowledged lack of adequate support systems prior to 2022 suggests a backlog of unmet mental health needs among these veterans, making them potentially more vulnerable to the amplified trauma of the full-scale invasion  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]).
    - **Impact of the Full-Scale Invasion:** The full-scale Russian invasion in 2022 has had a profound impact on the mental health of the entire Ukrainian population. Ukraine's Ministry of Health anticipates that approximately 15 million people will require various forms of psychological support to stabilize their emotional state, and an estimated 3 to 4 million individuals will need medication to manage mental health problems resulting from the war  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). While these figures encompass the general population, they underscore the immense scale of the mental health crisis facing the nation. Veterans, having been on the front lines and directly exposed to the most intense violence, undoubtedly constitute a significant portion of this population requiring support. This projection by the Ministry of Health, involving such a large segment of the population, highlights the deep and widespread psychological trauma inflicted by the full-scale invasion. The sheer number of individuals predicted to need psychological support suggests a potential overwhelming of the existing mental health infrastructure, emphasizing the urgency of addressing the mental health needs of veterans as a critical component of the broader national response.
    - **Prevalence Estimates:** Currently, there is no publicly available official data on the specific prevalence of PTSD among Ukrainian soldiers and veterans  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). However, experts estimate that the prevalence of PTSD in this population is around 30%, with the occurrence of the condition being influenced by factors such as deployment location, gender, combat exposure, and other variables  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). The Health Ministry reported a notable increase in overall mental health diagnoses from 3,167 in 2021 to 12,494 in 2023, although it remains unclear whether military personnel are included in these figures  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). Despite the absence of official military-specific PTSD statistics, the expert consensus suggesting a high prevalence rate of approximately 30% among Ukrainian veterans indicates a significant mental health burden within this group. This estimate likely stems from clinical observations and experiences of professionals working with veterans. The substantial increase in overall mental health diagnoses reported by the Health Ministry, even if it does not specifically isolate military personnel, could reflect a growing awareness and recognition of PTSD and other war-related mental health conditions within the broader population, potentially including veterans seeking help.
    - **Civilian Studies as Indicators:** Several studies have focused on the mental health of Ukrainian civilians, including refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), providing insights into the widespread trauma within the country. These studies have revealed alarmingly high rates of PTSD symptoms. For instance, a study examining Ukrainians internally displaced after the annexation of Crimea and the war in Eastern Ukraine reported a PTSD prevalence of 27.4% using the DSM PCL-5 questionnaire  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]). Another study conducted during the ongoing Russian invasion found an extremely high prevalence of severe PTSD symptoms among nearly 1300 Ukrainian civilians  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]). Among forced migrants from Ukraine following the 2022 invasion, almost half (47.5%) were found to have probable PTSD  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]). Furthermore, research surveying over 8,000 displaced Ukrainians reported high levels of PTSD and anxiety, particularly among those remaining within Ukraine  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]). While these studies focus on civilian populations, the consistently high rates of PTSD and other mental health issues among Ukrainians exposed to war-related trauma strongly suggest that Ukrainian veterans, who have experienced direct combat, are also at high risk for developing PTSD. If a significant portion of the civilian population, who may have experienced trauma indirectly through witnessing attacks or displacement, exhibit such high PTSD rates, it is highly probable that veterans, directly involved in combat and facing life-threatening situations, would experience similar or even greater levels of psychological distress. Therefore, civilian data can serve as a concerning indicator of the potential magnitude of PTSD among veterans.
    - **Risk Factors:** Research has identified several risk factors associated with PTSD among Ukrainians. Studies on civilians have indicated that female gender, older age, forced displacement, living in geographically occupied regions, and lower levels of education are correlated with a greater severity of PTSD symptoms  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]). While these findings are primarily based on civilian populations, some of these factors, such as gender and the experience of displacement (which could occur during or after military service), are likely relevant for veterans as well. Notably, a study mentioned in  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]) found that previous family trauma of genocide is associated with PTSD symptoms specifically in active soldiers. These demographic and experiential factors may increase the vulnerability of Ukrainian veterans to PTSD, mirroring trends observed in the civilian population. The significant link between historical trauma, such as experiences of genocide in previous generations, and PTSD in soldiers suggests a potential intergenerational impact of conflict that is particularly relevant in the Ukrainian context. Understanding these risk factors can aid in identifying veterans who are more susceptible to developing PTSD and in tailoring support and intervention efforts to their specific needs. The intergenerational impact of trauma on soldiers warrants further investigation to inform culturally sensitive and effective mental health services.
    - **Complex PTSD (CPTSD):** The prolonged and intense nature of the conflict in Ukraine may lead to a significant number of veterans developing complex PTSD (CPTSD). Snippet  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) highlights this risk due to repeated trauma exposure faced by soldiers involved in heavy fighting. CPTSD is characterized by symptoms that extend beyond those of standard PTSD, including significant difficulties in emotional regulation, distorted self-perception, and challenges in forming and maintaining relationships  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]). The cyclical pattern of month-long frontline rotations followed by brief reconstitution periods, as mentioned in  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]), indicates that Ukrainian soldiers are frequently re-exposed to traumatic experiences. This continuous exposure to combat and traumatic events increases the likelihood of developing CPTSD, a more severe and complex condition that necessitates more specialized and long-term treatment approaches compared to standard PTSD. The potential for CPTSD among Ukrainian veterans has significant implications for the type and duration of psychological support required to facilitate their recovery and reintegration into civilian life.
- **2.2. PTSD Among Russian Veterans:**
    - **Data Scarcity:** Obtaining reliable data on the prevalence of PTSD among Russian veterans returning from the war in Ukraine is challenging due to the scarcity of official information  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). This lack of transparency from the Russian government makes it difficult to accurately assess the psychological toll of the war on its soldiers. The Russian government's reluctance to release data on veteran PTSD suggests a potential underestimation or downplaying of the psychological impact of the war on its soldiers. This lack of transparency could stem from various reasons, including a desire to maintain morale among the armed forces and the general population, or to control the narrative surrounding the "special military operation." The absence of official figures necessitates reliance on estimates and indirect indicators, making it difficult to formulate evidence-based policies and interventions for Russian veterans.
    - **Estimates and Expert Opinions:** Despite the limited official data, several sources provide estimates regarding PTSD prevalence among Russian veterans. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anna Tsivileva stated that PTSD already affects 20% of Russian veterans returning from the front in Ukraine  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 10]]). However, clinical studies cited in the same report suggest that the number of people who suffer from this disorder across all conflicts typically ranges between 25% and 50%  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 10]]). A therapist working with soldiers estimated that about 20–30% of combat veterans return home with PTSD and require rehabilitation  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 11]]). Furthermore, the UK Defense Ministry reported that Russian psychologists had identified at least 100,000 military personnel suffering from PTSD as early as December 2022  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]). While official data is scarce, these various sources consistently indicate a significant prevalence of PTSD among Russian veterans, with estimates ranging from 20% to 50%. The early identification of a substantial number of cases by late 2022 underscores the potential scale of the problem, even in the absence of comprehensive official acknowledgement. The discrepancy between the lower figure provided by the Deputy Defense Minister and the higher ranges from clinical studies and expert opinions might reflect political considerations or differing methodologies in data collection and reporting.
    - **Focus on "Post-Traumatic Growth":** A concerning trend has emerged in Russia where openly discussing PTSD is reportedly becoming "bad form." Instead, there is a growing preference among many psychologists and public figures to focus on "post-traumatic growth," which refers to the positive effects that combat experience can supposedly have on individuals  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]). This societal and potentially officially sanctioned emphasis on "post-traumatic growth" in Russia may hinder the recognition and treatment of PTSD among veterans. By downplaying the negative psychological consequences of war and promoting the idea of positive outcomes, it could create a stigma around acknowledging and seeking help for mental health problems. This might prevent veterans from accessing necessary psychological support, potentially leading to a lack of treatment and increased long-term mental health issues for affected individuals.
    - **Comparison to Other Conflicts:** The potential long-term impact of the war in Ukraine on Russian veterans has been compared to the "Vietnam syndrome" in the United States, suggesting that hundreds of thousands of Russian combatants could be plagued by PTSD for the rest of their lives  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 10]]). Similarly, there is concern within the Kremlin about a potential reemergence of the "Afghan syndrome," which describes the disillusionment and psychological trauma experienced by Soviet veterans after the war in Afghanistan  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 13]]). These comparisons to historical conflicts highlight the potential for widespread and enduring psychological and social consequences for Russian veterans if PTSD is not adequately addressed. The "Vietnam syndrome" and "Afghan syndrome" serve as historical examples of the profound and lasting impact of war-related trauma on veterans and society, emphasizing the critical importance of proactive and comprehensive support systems. The Russian government's awareness of these precedents suggests an understanding of the potential for similar challenges arising from the Ukraine conflict.
    - **Lower PTSD Rates in Military vs. Civilians (General Conflict):** A meta-analysis examining mental health during times of conflict or war indicated that the aggregate prevalence of post-traumatic stress was 23.5%  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 14]]). Interestingly, this study found no significant difference in the levels of post-traumatic stress between civilian and military groups in general conflict situations  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 14]]). While this meta-analysis suggests potentially similar PTSD rates between military personnel and civilians in broader conflict contexts, this finding should not diminish the urgent need for mental health support for Russian veterans of the Ukraine war. The specific intensity and nature of this conflict, including reports of "meat grinder" tactics involving repeated assaults and potentially inadequate training for Russian soldiers  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 15]]), could lead to higher rates of PTSD compared to general trends. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the unique circumstances of the Ukraine war when assessing the mental health needs of Russian veterans.
    - **US Veteran Data as a Reference Point:** Data from US veteran populations who served in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) show that 15.7% of deployed veterans screened positive for PTSD compared to 10.9% of non-deployed veterans  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 17]]). While these figures are specific to a different conflict and military force, they offer a comparative perspective on the potential prevalence of PTSD in a military population following deployment. This data can provide a general benchmark for understanding the potential scale of PTSD among Russian veterans returning from Ukraine, although significant differences in the characteristics of the conflicts, military cultures, and available support systems necessitate careful interpretation of such comparisons.
- **2.3. Comparative Analysis of PTSD Rates:**
    - **Higher Estimates for Ukrainian Veterans:** Based on the available data, particularly the expert estimates of around 30% and the high rates of PTSD symptoms observed in Ukrainian civilian populations, the estimated prevalence of PTSD among Ukrainian veterans appears to be potentially higher than the more conservative official estimate of 20% reported by the Russian Deputy Defense Minister for Russian veterans  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). However, it is important to note that clinical studies suggest the actual rate among Russian veterans could be significantly higher, ranging from 25% to 50%  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 10]]). The lack of comprehensive and transparent data from Russia makes it challenging to draw a definitive conclusion regarding which group experiences a higher prevalence of PTSD. The discrepancy in the Russian estimates themselves highlights the uncertainty surrounding the true psychological impact of the war on their veterans. The intense and prolonged fighting on Ukrainian territory, coupled with the existential threat to the nation, may contribute to higher trauma levels among Ukrainian soldiers. Conversely, the Russian focus on "post-traumatic growth" might lead to underreporting of PTSD cases within their veteran population.
    - **Impact of Ongoing Conflict:** Research indicates that Ukrainian civilians who remain within Ukraine, exposed to the ongoing war, tend to experience poorer mental health outcomes compared to those who have become refugees  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]). This observation could also extend to veterans. Ukrainian veterans who remain in a country still actively at war might face continued exposure to stressors and reminders of their traumatic experiences, potentially exacerbating PTSD symptoms or hindering recovery. In contrast, Russian veterans, upon returning home, are geographically removed from the immediate war zone, although they are still subject to the broader societal and economic consequences of the conflict. This difference in the immediate post-conflict environment might influence the trajectory of PTSD development and recovery in veterans from both countries.
    - **Methodological Differences:** The methods used to assess PTSD prevalence could differ significantly between Ukraine and Russia. In Ukraine, studies have utilized standardized assessment tools like the PCL-5 questionnaire  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]), which allows for more reliable and comparable data. Information regarding the assessment methods used in Russia to generate their PTSD estimates is not readily available in the provided material. These potential differences in assessment methodologies could influence the reported rates of PTSD and make direct comparisons between the two countries more challenging. Without knowing the specific tools and criteria used in Russia, it is difficult to evaluate the validity and comparability of their reported figures with those from Ukrainian studies.

**3. Criminal Activity Among Demobilized Veterans:**

- **3.1. Criminal Activity Among Ukrainian Veterans:**
    - **Focus on Desertion:** A significant number of desertion cases have been reported within the Ukrainian army. Between January and August 2024, 45,543 Ukrainian soldiers were reported to have deserted  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]). This high rate of desertion might indicate considerable psychological distress, disillusionment, or fear among active servicemen, potentially leading to difficulties in their reintegration into civilian life after the war. While desertion itself is a military offense committed during service, the scale of it suggests underlying issues within the armed forces that could have implications for post-demobilization behavior. Soldiers who desert might face legal consequences and social stigma, potentially increasing their vulnerability to engaging in other forms of criminal activity if they lack adequate support and opportunities upon returning to civilian life.
    - **Organized Crime Risks:** Given the large number of Ukrainians who have served in the military and the potential availability of weapons, there is a recognized risk of veterans becoming involved in organized crime  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 19]]). With over one million Ukrainians currently in military service, and 300,000 of them in active combat, even a small fraction becoming involved in criminal activity could have a profound impact on Ukrainian society  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 19]]). Veterans with combat experience and potential military skills could be targeted for recruitment by organized crime groups, particularly if they face economic hardship, unemployment, or feelings of alienation and lack of purpose after the war. This potential for veteran involvement in organized crime poses a significant challenge to post-war stability and security in Ukraine, requiring proactive measures to mitigate this risk.
    - **Lack of Specific Post-Demobilization Crime Statistics:** The provided research material does not contain specific official statistics or research on criminal offenses committed by Ukrainian veterans _after_ their demobilization from military service. While there is a general concern expressed in  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 20]]) that returning veterans _could_ contribute to an increase in violent crime rates, this is presented as a potential future issue rather than being based on concrete data. The absence of specific data on post-demobilization criminal activity by Ukrainian veterans makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the current situation or to directly compare their involvement in crime with that of Russian veterans. This lack of data might suggest that the issue is either not yet as prominent as in Russia, or that comprehensive data collection and reporting mechanisms specifically tracking post-demobilization crime among veterans are still in development in Ukraine.
- **3.2. Criminal Activity Among Russian Veterans:**
    - **Rising Violent Crime:** Multiple sources indicate a significant increase in violent crime in Russia, and returning veterans from the war in Ukraine have been identified as a contributing factor to this rise  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 20]]). Statistics from the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs show that more serious crimes were committed between January and August 2024 than during any comparable period in the previous 13 years  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 22]]). This growing evidence suggests a direct link between the return of Russian veterans and a noticeable increase in violent crime rates across the country, indicating significant challenges in their reintegration and potential psychological distress leading to aggressive behavior. The temporal correlation between the return of veterans and the reported surge in violent crime strongly suggests a causal relationship, where the trauma of combat, possibly compounded by inadequate mental health support, contributes to increased aggression and violent tendencies in some veterans.
    - **Crimes Committed by Returning Soldiers:** Investigative reporting by the independent news outlet Vyorstka has provided specific data on violent crimes committed by Russian soldiers after returning from Ukraine. According to their tally, these soldiers have killed over 100 people since the full-scale invasion began. This includes 76 murders, 18 deaths resulting from grievous bodily harm, 11 fatalities in car crashes, and 2 deaths from coerced drug use  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 23]]). Additionally, another 100 individuals were reported to have been seriously injured by returning soldiers  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 23]]). These figures encompass both regular soldiers and former convicts who were pardoned after fighting in Ukraine  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 23]]). This specific data on homicides and serious injuries committed by returning Russian soldiers, including both regular servicemen and pardoned convicts, offers alarming evidence of a significant problem with violent crime within this population, highlighting the potential dangers to public safety and the profound psychological impact of the war on these individuals. The detailed statistics from Vyorstka provide concrete evidence of the scale of the problem, and the inclusion of pardoned convicts is particularly concerning, as individuals with pre-existing criminal tendencies might be more likely to re-offend after experiencing the trauma of war, especially without proper rehabilitation and reintegration support.
    - **Kremlin Concerns:** The Russian government itself has acknowledged concerns regarding the rise in aggression and violence among men returning from the war in Ukraine  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 24]]). A high-ranking official in the Presidential Administration reportedly stated in a closed meeting that Russian war veterans "adapt poorly" to civilian life and that many convict recruits commit violent crimes after their return  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 13]]). This official recognition from the Kremlin underscores the severity of the problem and suggests an awareness at the highest levels of government regarding the potential for social instability and public discontent stemming from the difficulties faced by returning veterans, particularly those recruited from prisons. The specific mention of convict recruits highlights a potential consequence of this controversial recruitment strategy.
    - **"New Elite" Narrative vs. Reality:** Despite the Kremlin's efforts to portray returning veterans as the "new elite" of Russia  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 22]]), reports indicate that a significant number of these individuals have been involved in criminal activity  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 22]]). This discrepancy between the official narrative and the reality on the ground creates a potential crisis of public trust and further stigmatizes veterans who are struggling with the psychological consequences of war. The attempt to idealize veterans is contradicted by the increasing reports of their involvement in violent crime, potentially eroding public faith in the government's handling of the war's social consequences. This disconnect can also hinder efforts to provide effective support if the government is unwilling to fully acknowledge the extent of the problem.
    - **Increase in Military Crimes:** Data from the Prosecutor General's Office in Russia indicates a significant surge in military crimes in 2022, with the number of registered crimes against military service nearly tripling compared to the previous year  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 25]]). This increase includes offenses such as desertion and insubordination, suggesting issues with discipline and morale within the Russian military during the war  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 25]]). This substantial rise in military crimes such as desertion and insubordination during the war could be a precursor to difficulties in adjusting to civilian life and potentially contribute to criminal behavior after demobilization. Individuals who struggled to adhere to military rules and regulations might also face challenges in conforming to civilian laws and social norms upon their return.
- **3.3. Comparative Analysis of Criminal Activity:**
    - **Evidence of Higher Crime Rates Among Russian Veterans:** Based on the available information, there is more direct and specific evidence indicating a higher rate of criminal activity, particularly violent crime, among Russian veterans after their demobilization from the war in Ukraine compared to Ukrainian veterans. While concerns exist in Ukraine regarding potential future involvement in organized crime and a high rate of desertion within the active military, the data on Russia, including specific homicide statistics and official acknowledgements of adaptation difficulties and criminal behavior, is more concrete and alarming. The recruitment of prisoners into the Russian army, the reported "meat grinder" tactics leading to high casualties, and potential limitations in adequate psychological support might contribute to a higher propensity for violence among some Russian veterans. While Ukrainian veterans also experience immense trauma, factors such as a stronger sense of national purpose in their defense of their homeland and potentially more accessible support systems might mitigate the risk of criminal behavior to some extent, although further research is needed to confirm this.
    - **Data Limitations for Ukraine:** The lack of specific statistics on criminal offenses committed by Ukrainian veterans after their demobilization in the provided research material makes a direct quantitative comparison with Russia challenging. The focus on desertion within the active military and the potential future risks of organized crime involvement suggest areas of concern, but concrete data on crimes committed by veterans in civilian life is largely absent in these snippets. This absence of specific data on post-demobilization criminal activity by Ukrainian veterans could be attributed to various factors, including a potentially lower actual rate of such crime compared to Russia, differences in reporting practices and data collection, or a lack of comprehensive studies specifically focused on this issue to date.

**4. Factors Influencing Mental Health Differences:**

- **4.1. Social Support Systems:**
    - **Ukraine:** Ukraine has developed a multifaceted and increasingly robust network of social support initiatives for its veterans. These include the establishment of veteran hubs, such as the one in Brovary, Kyiv Oblast, which provide psychological and legal assistance to war veterans and their families  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 26]]). Crisis support hotlines, like the one operated by the Ukrainian Veterans Foundation, offer 24/7 toll-free support from qualified psychologists trained in crisis intervention  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 28]]). Numerous non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a vital role in providing a wide range of assistance, including medical aid, financial support, and psychological rehabilitation. Organizations such as United Help Ukraine, Veteran Aid Ukraine, and Razom for Ukraine offer essential supplies, medical equipment, and mental wellness programs for veterans and their families  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 29]]). International organizations, such as the EU and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), also contribute to these efforts by supporting veterans' employment, community resilience, and providing psychosocial support services  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]). This comprehensive and collaborative approach indicates a strong commitment to addressing the diverse needs of Ukrainian veterans.
    - **Russia:** Russia provides a system of social support for its veterans that includes various financial and material benefits. Combat veterans are entitled to compensation for housing costs, property and land tax exemptions, priority medical services, and monthly cash payments  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). The government also established the "Defenders of the Fatherland" fund in 2023 with the aim of providing comprehensive support to veterans and their families, including psychological assistance, medical care, social support, and employment assistance  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 10]]). However, there are concerns about the adequacy of psychological support within this system. Despite reports of rising violence committed by returning soldiers, PTSD appears to receive limited specific attention, with some efforts focusing on providing recommendations for veterans' wives on how to manage their husbands' mental health  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 24]]). Furthermore, there are indications that social welfare funds in some regions are being significantly diverted to provide sign-on bonuses for new contract soldiers, potentially at the expense of other crucial social programs, including long-term support for veterans  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]). This suggests a potential imbalance in the allocation of resources, with less emphasis on direct and professional psychological care for veterans themselves.
    - **Comparative Analysis:** In comparing the social support systems of Ukraine and Russia for their veterans, it becomes evident that Ukraine has developed a more diverse and actively utilized network that places a significant emphasis on addressing the psychological needs of veterans. The strong involvement of NGOs and international partners in Ukraine complements governmental efforts to provide a wide range of mental health services, including specialized programs, crisis hotlines, and veteran hubs. While Russia offers a system of financial and material benefits and has established a dedicated fund for veteran support, there are concerns regarding the prioritization and accessibility of psychological care. The reported shortage of mental health professionals, the focus on family-based support for mental health issues, and the potential diversion of social welfare funds raise questions about the adequacy of Russia's system in meeting the complex psychological needs of its returning soldiers. Therefore, Ukrainian veterans likely have access to a broader and more specialized range of psychological support services compared to Russian veterans, where the focus might be more on financial and material assistance, with potential limitations in mental health care.
- **4.2. Governmental Rehabilitation Programs:**
    - **Ukraine:** The Ukrainian government, often in partnership with international organizations, has implemented various programs aimed at the rehabilitation and reintegration of its veterans. The Ministry of Veterans Affairs plays a crucial role in developing policies and coordinating these efforts  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]). The IREX Veteran Reintegration Program, with support from the U.S. Department of State, focuses on improving the quality and accessibility of services for veterans, including psychosocial and physical rehabilitation, as well as employment and vocational training opportunities  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]). The EU and IOM are also jointly supporting projects aimed at veterans' employment and community resilience, including vocational training and psychosocial support services  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]). Additionally, initiatives like the "Return/Повернення" project offer specialized reorientation, adaptation, and reintegration programs for veterans and their families, with a strong emphasis on psychological training and support  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 37]]). These programs indicate a concerted effort to address the multifaceted needs of veterans as they transition back to civilian life.
    - **Russia:** Russia has established governmental initiatives to support its veterans, most notably the "Defenders of the Fatherland" State Fund, which aims to provide medical, social, and employment assistance, including psychological support  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 10]]). Additionally, Moscow announced a program in 2023 focused on the "detection" and "prevention" of PTSD among soldiers at the front, involving temporary "basic treatment" before their return to combat  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 10]]). However, concerns have been raised regarding the actual availability and quality of psychological rehabilitation services. Reports indicate a severe shortage of psychologists and treatment centers across Russia, which likely limits the effectiveness and reach of these programs  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 38]]). Furthermore, the Kremlin's efforts to control veteran-based civil society and co-opt loyalist veterans into state-controlled organizations might restrict access to independent and community-based support options  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 13]]). The focus on "detection" and "prevention" at the front might not adequately address the complex and long-term needs of veterans who have already been demobilized and are struggling with PTSD and reintegration into civilian life.
    - **Comparative Analysis:** When comparing the governmental rehabilitation programs for veterans in Ukraine and Russia, Ukraine appears to have a more comprehensive and diverse range of initiatives, with a stronger emphasis on psychosocial support and a more open environment for collaboration with non-governmental and international organizations. The focus on employment, physical rehabilitation, and mental health in Ukrainian programs suggests a holistic approach to veteran reintegration. While Russia has established the "Defenders of the Fatherland" fund as a central pillar of its veteran support system, significant concerns remain regarding the actual capacity and focus on psychological rehabilitation, particularly in light of the reported shortage of mental health professionals and the government's apparent desire to maintain control over veteran initiatives. The limited scope of the PTSD program, focusing primarily on detection and prevention at the front, might not be sufficient to meet the needs of demobilized veterans. Therefore, Ukrainian veterans likely have access to a broader spectrum of rehabilitation programs, particularly in the crucial area of mental health, compared to Russian veterans, where resources may be more limited and centrally controlled.
- **4.3. Societal Attitudes and Stigma:**
    - **Ukraine:** Societal attitudes towards veterans in Ukraine are generally characterized by high levels of trust and respect. Surveys indicate that a significant majority of Ukrainians express trust in veterans currently in active service (96%) and veterans involved in the present conflict (94%)  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 39]]). This reflects a deep admiration for those who have defended the country. However, alongside this respect, there is also a growing awareness of the potential challenges that veterans may face upon their return to civilian life, including psychoemotional instability, difficulties with physical health, societal misunderstandings, and the risk of suicides and criminal activities  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 39]]). Despite the prevalent respect, some veterans report feeling excluded from society and believe that only those with military experience can truly understand them  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 41]]). Additionally, there is a decreasing perception among Ukrainians that the state is adequately fulfilling its obligations to veterans  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 39]]). While societal respect remains high, the recognition of the difficulties veterans might encounter and the declining trust in state support suggest a complex interplay of attitudes.
    - **Russia:** Societal attitudes towards Russian veterans appear to be more varied and at times contradictory. While the Kremlin promotes a narrative of veterans as the "new elite" of Russia  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 22]]), there are also reports of widespread indifference and apathy towards the war among the general population  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 43]]). Some veterans have reported experiencing negative attitudes, including being denied entry to hotels and restaurants while in military uniform, and their children being subjected to bullying at school  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 45]]). Furthermore, there is a growing awareness among "regular" Russians of their perceived lower status compared to veterans and those working in the armaments industry, which can lead to social friction  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 45]]). The Russian government's fear of independent veteran groups critical of the war effort  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 13]]) and its attempts to control the narrative surrounding veterans' experiences might also contribute to a less openly supportive social environment for those struggling with PTSD and reintegration. The mixed attitudes, ranging from official glorification to public indifference and even hostility in some cases, could create a challenging environment for veterans seeking to reintegrate into civilian life.
    - **Comparative Analysis:** In comparing societal attitudes, Ukrainian veterans generally seem to be held in higher regard and benefit from greater public trust and respect compared to Russian veterans. While Ukrainians acknowledge the potential challenges veterans face, the overall sentiment is largely positive. In contrast, Russian veterans may encounter more mixed attitudes, ranging from the officially promoted heroic image to public indifference and even negative interactions. The Russian government's efforts to control the narrative and suppress independent veteran voices further differentiate the social environments in the two countries. This difference in societal support and the level of stigma associated with seeking help for mental health issues could significantly impact the psychological well-being and reintegration outcomes of veterans in Ukraine and Russia. The more positive and supportive societal attitudes in Ukraine might foster a greater sense of community belonging and reduce the stigma associated with seeking mental health support, potentially leading to better psychological outcomes compared to Russian veterans who might face more stigma and social isolation.
- **4.4. Nature of Combat Experience:**
    - **Ukraine:** The combat experience of Ukrainian soldiers in the ongoing conflict has been characterized by intense and prolonged engagements. Soldiers often face continuous artillery barrages, repeated waves of assaults, and close-quarters fighting, making it difficult to distinguish between enemy and friendly forces  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]). They are frequently exposed to significant destruction of infrastructure and civilian areas, and many have suffered personal losses of comrades and loved ones  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]). The war has largely devolved into a brutal war of attrition, with trench warfare reminiscent of World War I becoming a common feature  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 46]]). The extensive use of artillery and increasingly, drone warfare, adds another layer of psychological stress  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 46]]). This highly intense and protracted combat, coupled with the defensive nature of their fight to protect their homeland against an aggressor, while potentially providing a sense of purpose, also carries a profound emotional burden of witnessing widespread devastation and enduring constant threat.
    - **Russia:** Russian soldiers involved in the war in Ukraine have also experienced brutal and attritional combat. Reports suggest that their tactics often involve "meat grinder" assaults, resulting in high manpower losses  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 15]]). There are indications of inadequate training and equipment for many Russian soldiers, leading to a reliance on basic and often ineffective tactics, such as simply "following the leader"  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 15]]). Russia has suffered substantial losses of both personnel and military equipment  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 16]]). The initial planning for the invasion was reportedly flawed, with a significant underestimation of Ukrainian resistance  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 48]]). This combination of intense combat, potential lack of preparedness, and high casualty rates is likely to contribute to significant psychological trauma among Russian soldiers. Furthermore, the lack of a clear and unifying ideological purpose for the war among many Russian soldiers, particularly conscripts and those who may not fully support the invasion, might exacerbate their psychological distress. The feeling of being ill-prepared and expendable in a conflict with unclear objectives could compound the trauma experienced during combat.
    - **Comparative Analysis:** While both Ukrainian and Russian soldiers are enduring highly traumatic combat experiences, the specific characteristics and underlying motivations may differ. Ukrainian soldiers are fighting for the defense of their homeland and the survival of their nation, which could foster a sense of purpose and resilience, although it also brings the emotional weight of witnessing the destruction of their country. Russian soldiers, on the other hand, particularly those conscripted or lacking strong ideological conviction, might experience different psychological stressors related to morale, the perceived justness of the cause, and feelings of inadequacy due to reported issues with training and equipment. The tactical approaches reported in the snippets, such as the "human wave" attacks by Russian forces, suggest a potential disregard for individual soldier welfare that could contribute to increased psychological distress. The differing motivations for fighting, the perceived legitimacy of the conflict, and the reported disparities in training and tactical effectiveness between the two armies could all contribute to variations in the psychological impact of combat and the subsequent development of PTSD among veterans from Ukraine and Russia.

**5. Psychological Assistance and Rehabilitation Programs: A Detailed Comparison:**

- **5.1. Ukraine:** Ukraine has established a comprehensive and multi-layered system of psychological assistance and rehabilitation programs for its veterans. The government, through the Ministry of Veterans Affairs, plays a central role in policy development and coordination  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]). A key initiative is the IREX Veteran Reintegration Program, supported by the U.S. Department of State, which focuses on improving access to psychosocial rehabilitation services and has trained numerous social workers to address the psychological needs of veterans  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]). This program also supports the operation of veteran hubs in various cities and a dedicated national hotline  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 36]]). Complementing these governmental efforts is a strong and active network of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and volunteer groups. Organizations like Veteran Hub, Blue Bird, the After Service Foundation, and Veteranka provide a range of mental health services, including individual and group therapy, support groups, and crisis hotlines  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 27]]). International organizations such as United Help Ukraine and Razom for Ukraine also contribute significantly to mental wellness programs for veterans and their families  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 29]]). Furthermore, specialized projects like "Return/Повернення" offer intensive reorientation, adaptation, and reintegration programs with a strong focus on psychological training and family support  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 37]]). The reported effectiveness and reach of these programs are substantial. The IREX program, for instance, has reached millions through mental health awareness campaigns and provided direct support to tens of thousands of individuals  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 36]]). The Crisis Support Hotline of the Ukrainian Veterans Foundation has handled a significant volume of calls from veterans and their relatives  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 28]]). Veteran Hubs have served thousands of visitors seeking assistance  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]). However, despite these efforts, the sheer scale of the mental health crisis in Ukraine, with millions estimated to be in need of support, indicates that ongoing expansion and increased resources are necessary to meet the needs of all veterans.
- **5.2. Russia:** Russia has established governmental initiatives to provide psychological support and rehabilitation to its veterans, primarily through the "Defenders of the Fatherland" State Fund  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 10]]). This fund aims to offer a range of assistance, including psychological, medical, social, and employment support. Additionally, a program focused on the "detection" and "prevention" of PTSD among soldiers deployed in Ukraine has been implemented, offering temporary "basic treatment" before their return to combat  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 10]]). Regional authorities may also have their own localized support measures for veterans  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). Despite these efforts, significant limitations and challenges exist within Russia's system for providing psychological care to veterans. A critical issue is the reported severe shortage of qualified psychologists and specialized treatment centers throughout the country  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 38]]). This lack of resources likely restricts the effectiveness and overall reach of available programs. Furthermore, the societal and potentially official emphasis on "post-traumatic growth" over acknowledging and treating PTSD might discourage veterans from seeking necessary psychological help due to stigma or a perceived lack of validation for their struggles  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]). The Kremlin's apparent efforts to control veteran-based civil society and co-opt loyalist veterans into state-run organizations could also limit the availability of independent and community-driven support options that might be more accessible or trusted by some veterans  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 13]]). Consequently, the effectiveness and reach of Russia's psychological support programs for veterans are likely limited, with many potentially not receiving adequate care. The reported reliance on veterans' wives to manage their husbands' mental health further suggests a potential gap in the provision of direct professional psychological support for veterans themselves  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 24]]).
- **5.3. Comparative Effectiveness and Reach:** When comparing the psychological assistance and rehabilitation programs in Ukraine and Russia, Ukraine appears to have a more developed, accessible, and diverse system. The presence of numerous NGOs, actively supported by international organizations, complements governmental initiatives to provide a wide array of mental health services tailored to the specific needs of veterans. This includes specialized therapies, support groups, and easily accessible crisis hotlines. In contrast, Russia's system, while having established a central fund for veteran support, faces significant resource constraints, particularly a shortage of qualified mental health professionals. The government's approach also seems more focused on centralized control and material support, potentially limiting the development of a comprehensive and independent mental health support infrastructure. The emphasis on "post-traumatic growth" in Russia might also create a greater barrier to veterans seeking help for PTSD due to increased stigma. Therefore, Ukrainian veterans likely have better access to a wider range of psychological support and rehabilitation services, potentially leading to more effective treatment and reintegration compared to Russian veterans who may face more limited resources, greater stigma, and a less supportive environment for addressing their mental health needs.

**6. Conclusion:**

This report has highlighted notable differences in the mental health and potential criminal behavior of Ukrainian and Russian veterans following their demobilization. While estimates suggest a possibly higher prevalence of PTSD among Ukrainian veterans, the lack of transparent data from Russia makes definitive conclusions challenging, with some indications pointing to a significant underreporting. Conversely, there is more direct and concerning evidence of increased criminal activity, particularly violent crime, among Russian veterans.

These disparities are likely influenced by a complex interplay of factors. Ukraine benefits from a more developed and accessible network of social support and rehabilitation programs, with a strong emphasis on mental health, bolstered by a robust NGO sector and international collaboration. Societal attitudes towards Ukrainian veterans are generally more positive and supportive. The intense but defensive nature of their combat experience might be somewhat mitigated by a stronger sense of national purpose and more readily available support. In contrast, Russia faces significant challenges in providing adequate psychological support due to resource limitations, potential stigma around PTSD possibly exacerbated by the focus on "post-traumatic growth," and a more complex and sometimes negative societal perception of veterans. The reported issues with training, tactics, and the potential lack of a clear ideological purpose for the war among some Russian soldiers might also contribute to higher rates of negative post-demobilization outcomes.

The long-term implications of these differences could be substantial for both societies. Ukraine will need to continue and expand its efforts to address the widespread mental health crisis among its veterans to ensure social cohesion and long-term stability. Russia's potential for increased crime rates among veterans and the likelihood of a significant number suffering from untreated PTSD pose serious threats to public safety and social order. The lack of transparency and the emphasis on controlling the narrative in Russia might hinder effective interventions and worsen these problems.

Further comprehensive and comparative research is essential to gain a more nuanced understanding of the long-term consequences of this conflict on veterans from both sides. This research should include rigorous epidemiological studies to accurately assess PTSD prevalence, in-depth analyses of the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs, qualitative studies exploring the lived experiences of veterans, and investigations into societal factors influencing reintegration and mental health outcomes. Improved access to transparent and official data from Russia is particularly critical for a more accurate assessment of the situation and for developing effective strategies to support the well-being of all affected veterans.
