# **Ukrainian Involvement in the UN Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) 2014–2021**

**1. Introduction:**

The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) was established by UN Security Council Resolution 2100 on April 25, 2013, with the primary objective of stabilizing the country following the 2012 Tuareg rebellion  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). The mission's mandate focused on supporting political processes, ensuring security, facilitating stabilization, and protecting civilians amidst a complex and volatile environment  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). MINUSMA became known as one of the UN's deadliest peacekeeping missions, reflecting the severe security challenges in the Sahel region  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). After over a decade of operation, the mission was terminated on June 30, 2023, with a full withdrawal of personnel and assets completed by December 31, 2023  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]).

The international peacekeeping efforts in Mali unfolded against a backdrop of significant internal conflict, including the Tuareg rebellion and the subsequent rise of various Islamist armed groups  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). The security landscape was further complicated by the involvement of other international military actors, such as France, which initially launched Operation Serval and later Operation Barkhane, a counter-insurgency operation aimed at combating terrorist groups across the Sahel zone  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 13]]). Additionally, the G5 Sahel Joint Force, comprising troops from Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger, also played a role in the regional security architecture  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 13]]). The presence of these diverse international actors with differing mandates underscored the intricate security environment within which Ukrainian forces may have operated.

This report aims to provide a detailed investigation into the participation of Ukrainian military and aviation units in MINUSMA during the period of 2014 to 2021, as requested. It will specifically address whether Ukrainian helicopter crews were officially part of the mission, which units were involved, the models of helicopters utilized (Mi-8, Mi-24), the tasks they undertook, the regions where they operated, any instances of combat losses or extreme situations encountered, their interactions with other international forces, and any available official or unofficial assessments of their work. Furthermore, this report will identify potential personal stories, photos, videos, and reports that could be relevant for the creation of a documentary video on this topic.

**2. Official Participation of Ukraine in MINUSMA (2014-2021):**

Official records from the United Nations indicate that Ukraine did contribute personnel to MINUSMA between 2014 and 2021. As of September 30, 2021, Ukraine's contribution stood at 12 personnel  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). While this number signifies an official presence, it is relatively small compared to the contributions of other nations such as Chad, Bangladesh, and Senegal, which numbered in the thousands  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). The specific roles and types of personnel within the Ukrainian contingent are not detailed in these general troop contribution lists, necessitating a more focused examination on aviation specialists as per the user's query. It is important to note that military and police personnel seconded to the UN for peacekeeping operations remain primarily members of their own national services  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 25]]). This implies that any Ukrainian helicopter crews involved in MINUSMA would have retained their affiliation with either the Ukrainian armed forces or a Ukrainian aviation company contracted for the mission.

Information available on the official MINUSMA website offers a slightly less clear picture regarding Ukraine's direct military contributions. While the website provides lists of countries contributing military force personnel  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 26]]), Ukraine is not explicitly mentioned in these general lists. This absence could potentially be attributed to the relatively smaller size of the Ukrainian contingent, or it might suggest that their contribution was facilitated through a contracted entity rather than solely through direct military deployment under the UN flag. It is also possible that the specific sections of the website reviewed focus on larger troop-contributing nations. The website does highlight the multinational nature of the mission, with military personnel working alongside UN Police and civilian colleagues to promote stability and security  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 27]]). However, without specific mention of Ukraine in the general military contributor lists, further investigation into more detailed UN reports on troop contributions by year is warranted to accurately track Ukraine's involvement and the nature of their roles throughout the 2014-2021 period. The discrepancy between the information derived from Wikipedia (citing UN data) and the general lists on the MINUSMA website necessitates a reliance on official UN sources for the most accurate representation of Ukrainian participation.

**3. Ukrainian Aviation Units and Helicopter Models Deployed:**

Evidence strongly suggests that Ukraine provided aviation support to MINUSMA through the deployment of helicopters and aircrews. Notably, reports indicate that MINUSMA faced an urgent need for armed helicopters following the withdrawal of the Ukrainian helicopter fleet  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 28]]). This withdrawal, which occurred in June 2022, significantly impacted MINUSMA's air capabilities, pointing to a substantial Ukrainian aviation presence prior to this date, well within the 2014-2021 timeframe of interest. The Ukrainian fleet deployed to MINUSMA included six helicopters, consisting of Mi-24 gunships and Mi-8 transport helicopters  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 28]]). The withdrawal of these vital assets was prompted by the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, as these helicopters were requisitioned by Kyiv to counter the Russian invasion  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 28]]). This event underscores the significance of the Ukrainian aviation contribution to the UN mission's operational capacity.

Further investigation reveals that the Ukrainian aviation support was likely provided by the Private Joint Stock Company Aviation Company "Ukrainian Helicopters"  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 30]]). This company has a long history of participating in UN missions worldwide, including in Mali since 2016, where they were contracted for aeromedical evacuation directly from incident sites and search and rescue operations  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]). The company's fleet includes modernized Mil-8MTV-1 helicopters, a specific variant of the Mi-8  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]). An incident in South Sudan in March 2025 involving a UN helicopter owned by "Ukrainian Helicopters" highlights the company's involvement in UN missions in Africa and the risks associated with these operations  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 30]]). A crew member involved in that incident had also participated in numerous rescue missions in other conflict zones, including Mali, indicating the company's extensive experience in the region  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]).

The helicopter models identified as part of the Ukrainian deployment, the Mi-24 (NATO reporting name: Hind) and the Mi-8 (NATO reporting name: Hip), are both of Soviet-era design with distinct capabilities  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). The Mi-24 is a large helicopter gunship designed for both attack and low-capacity troop transport, equipped with powerful anti-tank missiles, cannon fire, and rockets  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]). Its armored body and twin-engine design provide resilience in combat situations, and its advanced optics allow for precise strikes  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]). The Mi-8, while not as heavily armed as the Mi-24, serves as a versatile medium twin-turbine helicopter primarily used for transport, with a significant cargo capacity and reliability, making it ideal for transporting troops and heavy equipment  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). It can also be equipped with various weapon systems for self-defense or in specific operational contexts  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]). The Mil-8MTV-1 variant operated by "Ukrainian Helicopters" is a modernized version capable of performing a wide range of tasks in diverse weather conditions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]).

**4. Operational Tasks Performed by Ukrainian Helicopters:**

The Ukrainian helicopters deployed to MINUSMA, primarily operated by "Ukrainian Helicopters," fulfilled several critical operational tasks that were essential for the mission's effectiveness. These tasks included troop and personnel deployments, facilitating the movement of peacekeepers to various locations within Mali  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 28]]). The Mi-8's significant cargo capacity made it particularly well-suited for logistics and the delivery of food supplies and other essential materials to MINUSMA bases, often located in remote and challenging environments  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 28]]). A crucial role played by the Ukrainian aviation contingent was medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) of both peacekeepers and civilians. The helicopters provided a vital lifeline for those injured or requiring urgent medical attention, ensuring rapid transport to appropriate medical facilities  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 28]]). "Ukrainian Helicopters" was specifically contracted for aeromedical evacuation directly from incident sites, highlighting their expertise in this critical area  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]). Their involvement also extended to search and rescue (SAR) operations, utilizing their specialized helicopters, some equipped with night vision capabilities, to locate and assist personnel in distress  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]).

While the Mi-24 is inherently designed as a gunship with fire support capabilities, the provided information does not explicitly detail this as a routine task for the Ukrainian contingent within MINUSMA. However, given the volatile security situation and the Mi-24's armament, it is plausible that these helicopters were utilized for armed escort of convoys or in response to specific threats where aerial fire support was deemed necessary. The Mi-24's dual capability as both an attack and transport helicopter suggests its potential use in a variety of roles depending on the mission requirements  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]). Patrolling, as a primary task, is not explicitly mentioned in connection with the Ukrainian helicopters in the provided snippets.

The challenging operational environment in Mali, characterized by the country's large size, the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) on transport routes, severe seasonal floods, and a scarcity of reliable roads, underscored the critical importance of air assets for MINUSMA  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 36]]). Military transport helicopters, such as the Mi-8, were particularly valuable as they could carry armed personnel and secure their own landing zones, eliminating the need for additional ground troop deployment in often hostile areas  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 36]]). The overall lack of sufficient military helicopters and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft was a significant limitation for MINUSMA, impacting its ability to protect civilians effectively  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 36]]). The Ukrainian helicopter fleet, therefore, played a crucial role in mitigating some of these challenges by providing essential transport, evacuation, and potentially security support.

**5. Geographical Areas of Operation:**

The available research material provides some indications of the geographical areas within Mali where Ukrainian helicopters likely operated as part of MINUSMA, although specific and comprehensive details are limited. Gao and Timbuktu emerge as key regions for MINUSMA's air operations in general. The lack of necessary air assets in Sector Center, which covers the Mopti region, often necessitated the deployment of aircraft from the northern regions of Gao and Timbuktu  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 36]]). This suggests that Ukrainian helicopters, being a significant part of MINUSMA's air component, would likely have been active in these northern regions, providing transport, evacuation, and other support as needed. The MINUSMA mission maintained a substantial presence in Gao and Timbuktu, with bases and ongoing operations until its withdrawal  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]).

The company "Ukrainian Helicopters," which provided the bulk of the Ukrainian aviation support, has been operating in Mali since 2016, primarily focusing on aeromedical evacuation and search and rescue  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]). These types of missions would inherently require operations across various regions of Mali, depending on the location of incidents and the needs of the mission. While the snippet does not specify particular regions, the nature of aeromedical evacuation implies a wide geographical scope, potentially including areas such as Gao, Timbuktu, and possibly even the central region of Mopti, where the need for air support was particularly acute  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 36]]).

Although Bamako is the capital and headquarters of MINUSMA  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]), there is no specific mention of Ukrainian helicopters being primarily based or operating in that region in the provided snippets. The focus seems to be on the northern and central areas where the security situation was most challenging and the need for air transport and evacuation was greatest. Therefore, based on the available information, it is reasonable to infer that Ukrainian helicopters, particularly those operated by "Ukrainian Helicopters," were active in the regions of Gao and Timbuktu, and likely also in the Mopti region, supporting MINUSMA's mandate across these key operational areas.

**6. Combat Losses and Significant Incidents:**

The research material provided does not explicitly document any instances of combat losses or extreme situations involving Ukrainian personnel within MINUSMA during the period of 2014 to 2021. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the overall high-risk environment in which MINUSMA operated throughout this period. The mission suffered a significant number of fatalities, exceeding 300, making it the UN's deadliest peacekeeping operation  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). This high casualty rate indicates that all contingents, including the Ukrainian one, faced considerable dangers, even if specific incidents involving Ukrainian personnel are not detailed in these snippets. Attacks on MINUSMA peacekeepers from various contributing countries were frequent, highlighting the persistent threats from armed groups in the region  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]).

An incident involving "Ukrainian Helicopters" in South Sudan in March 2025, where a UN helicopter was shot down resulting in a fatality, serves as a stark reminder of the risks faced by Ukrainian aviation crews in UN peacekeeping operations in Africa  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 30]]). While this event occurred outside the specific timeframe and location of the user's query, it underscores the potential for extreme situations and the sacrifices made by personnel from "Ukrainian Helicopters" in the service of UN missions. The crew member who died in the South Sudan incident had extensive experience in rescue missions in various conflict hotspots, including Mali, suggesting that Ukrainian crews operating in MINUSMA were also likely exposed to dangerous and challenging situations.

Given the overall context of high casualties and frequent attacks on MINUSMA, it is plausible that the Ukrainian contingent, particularly the aviation component due to the nature of their operations, may have encountered unreported incidents or extreme situations during their deployment between 2014 and 2021. Further research into specific UN incident reports, Ukrainian media coverage from the period, or potentially contacting "Ukrainian Helicopters" directly might reveal additional information in this regard. However, based solely on the provided snippets, there is no explicit confirmation of combat losses or extreme situations involving Ukrainian personnel within MINUSMA during the specified timeframe.

**7. Interaction and Cooperation with Other International Forces:**

Ukrainian personnel serving in MINUSMA between 2014 and 2021 would have likely engaged in interaction and cooperation with other international forces present in Mali. A significant partner in the stabilization efforts was France, through its Operation Barkhane. Operation Barkhane provided crucial intelligence and logistical support to MINUSMA  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 16]]). Given that Ukrainian helicopters played a vital role in transport and medical evacuation for MINUSMA, coordination with French forces, who also had a substantial air presence and were responsible for force protection  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 37]]), would have been essential. This cooperation would have likely spanned logistical planning, airspace management, and potentially joint responses to security threats or medical emergencies. MINUSMA's operational framework was designed to have the peacekeeping forces working in conjunction with Malian and Barkhane forces, with the latter taking the lead in counter-terrorism operations  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 12]]).

Chad and Burkina Faso were also significant contributors to the MINUSMA peacekeeping force  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). As part of a multinational mission, Ukrainian personnel would have served alongside and potentially coordinated with contingents from these and other troop-contributing countries. This interaction could have occurred in various contexts, including joint patrols, base security, logistical movements, and participation in mission briefings and planning sessions. The Chadian contingent, in particular, played a prominent role in MINUSMA  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]).

It is worth noting a later development in the relationship between Ukraine and some of the countries involved in MINUSMA. After the 2014-2021 period, in August 2024, a diplomatic dispute arose between Ukraine and Mali, with Mali severing diplomatic ties, accusing Ukraine of supporting terrorist groups in the Sahel  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 38]]). Burkina Faso and Niger sided with Mali in this dispute  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 41]]). This later tension, while outside the timeframe of this report, highlights the complex and evolving geopolitical landscape in the region and its potential impact on how past contributions might be perceived. However, during the 2014-2021 period, the focus would have been on operational cooperation within the framework of the UN mission.

**8. Assessments and Recognition of Ukrainian Contribution:**

The provided research material does not contain explicit official assessments from the UN or the local Malian government specifically evaluating the performance of the Ukrainian contingent in MINUSMA during the 2014-2021 period. However, there are indicators that suggest a positive contribution, particularly from "Ukrainian Helicopters." This company, which provided the bulk of the Ukrainian aviation assets, has a documented history of receiving praise for its work in other international missions. For instance, they were highly commended for their firefighting efforts in Portugal and their successful rescue operations in East Africa  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]). This track record of positive performance in challenging operational environments suggests a level of professionalism and capability that would likely have been reflected in their service in MINUSMA as well.

Furthermore, the UN's recognition of a "Ukrainian Helicopters" crew member with the United Nations Medal of Honor for bravery and dedication during the South Sudan incident  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]) indicates that the organization values the contributions and acknowledges the sacrifices of personnel from this company involved in their missions. It is reasonable to infer that this recognition extends to their work in Mali, where they provided essential aeromedical evacuation and search and rescue services under the MINUSMA mandate.

While specific official reports assessing the Ukrainian contingent's overall impact on MINUSMA between 2014 and 2021 are not evident in the provided snippets, the continued reliance on "Ukrainian Helicopters" for critical aviation tasks within UN missions in Africa, including Mali, suggests a level of satisfaction with their performance and capabilities. Further research into UN press releases, mission reports that might specifically mention the aviation component and its effectiveness, or potentially Ukrainian media reports from the time could potentially yield more direct assessments of their contributions.

**9. Documentary Evidence for Video Production:**

The provided research snippets offer limited direct documentary evidence specifically related to Ukrainian peacekeepers or aviation personnel in MINUSMA during the 2014-2021 period. Personal stories from Ukrainian peacekeepers serving in MINUSMA within this timeframe are not present in the material. While snippets discuss the broader conflict in Ukraine and the experiences of Ukrainians in other contexts  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 38]]), these do not directly address their involvement in the UN mission in Mali. The tribute to the "Ukrainian Helicopters" crew member in UNMISS  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]) provides a poignant human story connected to the Ukrainian company that served in MINUSMA, offering a potential starting point for understanding the personal experiences of aviation personnel in similar UN operations.

Similarly, the snippets do not contain direct links to photos or videos of Ukrainian peacekeepers or their helicopters operating in Mali between 2014 and 2021. Several YouTube links and news reports are included  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]), but their descriptions do not specifically mention Ukrainian personnel in MINUSMA during the specified years. They generally cover the overall MINUSMA mission and the conflict in Ukraine. The Alamy stock photo search for "minusma"  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 50]]) might yield relevant images through further searching and verification, but no specific photos are provided in the snippets.

Numerous UN reports on MINUSMA and Ukraine are referenced throughout the snippets  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 51]]). These official documents are the most likely sources to contain valuable information about Ukrainian involvement, the specific tasks undertaken by their contingent, and any formal assessments of their performance. A thorough review of these reports, particularly those covering the 2014-2021 period, with a focus on troop contributions by country and the activities of the aviation component, is highly recommended.

To gather more documentary evidence for a video production, further targeted research is necessary. This should include a dedicated search for UN reports specifically mentioning Ukrainian contributions to MINUSMA, reaching out to "Ukrainian Helicopters" for potential archival materials such as personal accounts, photos, and videos, and exploring Ukrainian media archives for any coverage of their country's participation in the UN mission in Mali during the specified timeframe. Additionally, reviewing UN press releases and mission updates related to aviation activities in MINUSMA might provide valuable insights and potentially visual resources.

**10. Conclusion:**

The analysis of the provided research material indicates that Ukraine did participate in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) between 2014 and 2021. While the direct contribution of Ukrainian military personnel to the UN mission was relatively small, the involvement of the Ukrainian aviation company "Ukrainian Helicopters" was significant. This company deployed a fleet of helicopters, including Mi-8 transport variants (specifically the Mil-8MTV-1) and Mi-24 gunships, which were crucial for the mission's operations.

The primary tasks performed by Ukrainian helicopters in MINUSMA included troop and personnel deployment, logistical support through the transport of cargo and supplies, and critically, medical evacuation and search and rescue operations. These services were particularly vital given the challenging terrain and security situation prevalent in Mali. While the Mi-24 possesses fire support capabilities, the provided information does not explicitly confirm this as a routine task for the Ukrainian contingent in MINUSMA. The likely areas of operation for these helicopters were the northern regions of Gao and Timbuktu, as well as the central region of Mopti, which were key operational zones for MINUSMA's air assets.

The research material does not detail any specific combat losses or extreme situations involving Ukrainian personnel within MINUSMA during the 2014-2021 period. However, the overall high casualty rate of the mission underscores the inherent risks faced by all participating contingents. Ukrainian personnel likely interacted and cooperated with other international forces, most notably France through Operation Barkhane, in logistical and security matters, as well as with other major troop contributors like Chad and Burkina Faso as part of the multinational peacekeeping force.

Official assessments of the Ukrainian contingent's performance in MINUSMA during the specified timeframe are not explicitly found within the provided snippets. Nevertheless, the established positive reputation and track record of "Ukrainian Helicopters" in other UN missions suggest a valuable contribution to MINUSMA. The UN's recognition of the company's personnel in other contexts further supports this inference.

For the purpose of creating a documentary video, the provided material offers limited direct personal stories, photos, or videos of Ukrainian involvement in MINUSMA between 2014 and 2021. Therefore, further targeted research is strongly recommended. This should include a thorough examination of official UN reports on MINUSMA from the relevant period, direct engagement with "Ukrainian Helicopters" for archival resources, and exploration of Ukrainian media archives. Investigating UN press releases and mission updates related to aviation activities could also yield valuable information and potential visual content. Additionally, considering interviews with former MINUSMA personnel from other nations might provide anecdotal insights into their interactions with the Ukrainian contingent.
