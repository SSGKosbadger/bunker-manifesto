# **Ukraine's Involvement in Security Operations in Lebanon (2000-Present)**

**Executive Summary**

Ukraine has demonstrated a notable, albeit focused, involvement in security operations in Lebanon between 2000 and the present day. The most significant contribution was the deployment of the 3rd Separate Engineering Battalion as part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) from July 2000 to April 2006. This battalion played a crucial role in demining the volatile border region between Lebanon and Israel. Beyond this official military contingent, evidence regarding Ukrainian personnel within other national UNIFIL forces, the presence of Ukrainian private military companies during conflict escalations, or the participation of Ukrainian technical specialists in international border monitoring missions is limited within the scope of this analysis. However, Ukraine has actively engaged in the evacuation of its citizens from Lebanon during periods of conflict, most notably in 2006 and again in 2024, showcasing its commitment to the safety of its nationals in a volatile region.

**Introduction: The UNIFIL Mission and Ukraine's Interest**

The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was established in March 1978 by UN Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426 in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). The initial mandate of UNIFIL was to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restore international peace and security, and assist the Government of Lebanon in re-establishing its effective authority in the area  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). Over time, particularly following the 2006 Lebanon War, UNIFIL's mandate expanded through Resolution 1701 to include monitoring the cessation of hostilities, supporting the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) in deploying throughout the south, and preventing the area from being used for hostile activities  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). This evolution reflects the ongoing complexities and challenges in maintaining peace along the Lebanese-Israeli border.

Ukraine has a history of contributing to international peacekeeping efforts across various regions over the past three decades  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). Its decision to participate in UNIFIL in the early 2000s marked its first engagement in a peacekeeping mission within the Middle East  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). This willingness to contribute to international security in a potentially dangerous environment aligns with the objective of documenting Ukrainian involvement in high-risk areas for the intended documentary. Understanding the specifics of Ukraine's participation in UNIFIL and other security-related activities in Lebanon is crucial for accurately portraying their role in this complex geopolitical landscape.

**Official Ukrainian Military Contribution to UNIFIL (2000-2006): The 3rd Separate Engineering Battalion**

In 1999, the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan formally requested Ukraine's assistance with UNIFIL, specifically seeking an engineering contingent to undertake the critical task of demining the territory along the sensitive Israeli-Lebanon border  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). This request underscored a recognized need within UNIFIL for specialized capabilities in dealing with the pervasive threat of landmines and unexploded ordnance in this area. Ukraine responded positively to this appeal, leading to the deployment of the 3rd Separate Engineering Battalion.

The deployment of this battalion was officially authorized by a decree from the President of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, issued on June 20, 2000  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). From July 2000 to April 2006, the 3rd Ukrainian Separate Engineering Battalion served as an integral part of the UNIFIL mission  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). This sustained six-year commitment highlights the significance of Ukraine's contribution to the UN's efforts in maintaining stability in southern Lebanon during this period. The primary and most crucial task assigned to the Ukrainian engineers was the demining of the territory situated along the "Blue Line," the demarcation line identified by the UN to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]).

Operating in this highly sensitive border region, the 3rd Separate Engineering Battalion undertook a range of critical tasks. These included comprehensive engineering reconnaissance to identify hazardous areas, the operational demining and safe destruction of discovered munitions, the creation of safe passages through existing minefields, the arrangement and maintenance of roads and convoy routes essential for UNIFIL operations, and the construction of new strongholds and fortifications to enhance the security of UN positions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). Additionally, the battalion was responsible for clearly marking patrol routes to ensure the safety of UNIFIL personnel and, demonstrating their commitment beyond military duties, they also provided humanitarian aid to the local Lebanese population  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]).

Throughout its deployment, the size of the Ukrainian contingent fluctuated. In June 2003, the UN Secretary-General's report indicated a strength of 194 Ukrainian troops within UNIFIL  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]). A prior report from December 2002 listed 200 Ukrainian personnel  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 10]]), while a report from December 2001 noted a larger contingent of 638 troops  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 11]]). The battalion's operations were conducted through a series of rotations, with at least seven such rotations occurring during its six years of service  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). Notably, Colonel Andriy Kukharenko served as the commander of the battalion during its seventh rotation  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). These varying troop numbers likely reflected the evolving needs of the UNIFIL mission and Ukraine's capacity to contribute at different junctures.

The professionalism and dedication of the Ukrainian contingent were highly recognized by the leadership of UNIFIL. The Force Commander at the time, French General Alan Pellegrini, expressed his strong appreciation for the battalion's performance, highlighting both their technical expertise and their humanitarian approach  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). He reportedly stated that he had "no problems with Ukrbat," a common reference to the Ukrainian battalion, and considered the 3rd Separate Engineer Battalion to be an exemplary unit for other contingents within the mission  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). This positive assessment underscores the effectiveness and impact of the Ukrainian peacekeepers in a challenging operational environment.

Despite their commendable service, the Ukrainian engineers faced several challenges. Issues arose concerning the certification of their sapper equipment to ensure adequate protection for personnel  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). Furthermore, Ukraine lacked the specific international demining accreditation that would have allowed them to engage in broader humanitarian demining efforts for potential financial compensation  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). Concerns were also voiced by the battalion's leadership regarding the reduction in personnel numbers, which did not correspond with a decrease in their assigned workload  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). It is also important to note that prior attempts at demining the same area by engineering units from other nations, including Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Norway, and Poland, had been unsuccessful and had resulted in casualties, highlighting the inherent dangers of the tasks undertaken by the Ukrainian battalion  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]).

**Ukrainian Personnel within Other National UNIFIL Contingents**

Official data from UN troop contributions lists Ukraine as having 127 personnel involved in UNIFIL  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). It is plausible that this figure represents a smaller group, possibly a liaison or observer team, that remained after the main deployment of the 3rd Separate Engineering Battalion concluded in 2006. However, an examination of the lists detailing troop contributions from various countries  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) does not explicitly identify any Ukrainian personnel serving within the contingents of Poland, Italy, or France.

The user's inquiry specifically mentioned the possibility of Ukrainian helicopter pilots or crews working as part of other national contingents within UNIFIL. While the provided research materials do not offer direct evidence of this type of integration within UNIFIL, a separate incident report mentions Ukrainian crew members operating a UN-contracted helicopter involved in a medical evacuation mission in Somalia  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 13]]). This demonstrates that Ukrainian aviation personnel have been employed by the UN for specialized air operations in other peacekeeping contexts. It remains a possibility, although not directly supported by these documents, that similar arrangements, perhaps through contractual agreements or bilateral understandings not reflected in standard troop rosters, could have existed within UNIFIL for specialized roles like aviation.

Regarding the specific national contingents mentioned, Poland has maintained a presence in UNIFIL, cooperating with Irish and Hungarian forces  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 14]]). Their contingent has typically consisted of around 200 to 250 personnel  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 12]]). There is no indication in the provided material that Ukrainian personnel were integrated into the Polish contingent. Italy stands as a significant contributor to UNIFIL, with a force exceeding 1000 troops  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). Similarly, the research snippets do not suggest any Ukrainian personnel serving within the Italian ranks. France also maintains a notable presence in UNIFIL, with approximately 677 to 700 soldiers  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). Again, there is no evidence within these materials to indicate that Ukrainian personnel were part of the French contingent.

**Ukrainian Private Military Companies and Security Contractors in Lebanon during Conflict Escalations**

The provided research snippets do not contain any information regarding the involvement of Ukrainian private military companies (PMCs) or individual security contractors in Lebanon during the specified periods of heightened conflict in 2006, 2013, and 2021. While there is mention of Russian PMCs, such as Redut, Wagner, and Slavonic Corps, operating in other regions like Syria during similar timeframes  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 19]]), and a reference to Academi (formerly Blackwater) supporting the Ukrainian Armed Forces in a context unrelated to Lebanon  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 25]]), these instances do not point to Ukrainian PMC activity in Lebanon during the years in question. The absence of such information within these materials does not definitively confirm that no Ukrainian PMCs were present, but it suggests they did not play a publicly documented or significant role during these particular conflict escalations. Further focused research specifically on PMC activities in Lebanon during these periods would be necessary to draw more definitive conclusions.

**Ukrainian Technical Specialists and Observers in International Missions on the Lebanon-Israel Border**

The research snippets contain references to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), primarily in the context of their military observers being denied access to Ukraine's Crimea in 2014  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 26]]). There is no mention within these materials of any Ukrainian technical specialists or observers participating in OSCE missions specifically focused on the Lebanon-Israel border. Similarly, the European Union (EU) is mentioned in relation to its Advisory Mission for Civilian Security Sector Reform in Ukraine (EUAM Ukraine), which is an initiative focused on domestic reforms within Ukraine  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 29]]). The snippets do not provide any information about Ukrainian technical specialists or observers being involved in EU missions or operations along the Lebanon-Israel border. While UNIFIL itself employs international civilian and military staff  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]), and the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) has military observers, including Swiss personnel, who support UNIFIL in southern Lebanon  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]), there is no specific mention in these snippets of Ukrainian nationals serving in technical or observer roles within these UN frameworks along the border. The primary documented Ukrainian contribution to UNIFIL during the studied period was through the 3rd Separate Engineering Battalion.

**Ukrainian Involvement in Evacuation Operations during Conflicts in Lebanon and Israel**

During the 2006 Lebanon War, the Ukrainian government actively participated in the international effort to evacuate its citizens from the conflict zone  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]). Additionally, the Canadian evacuation operation, codenamed Operation LION, also facilitated the departure of Ukrainians alongside nationals from other countries  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]). Estimates at the time suggested that approximately 1200 Ukrainian citizens were residing in Lebanon  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]). Reports indicate that around 379 Ukrainians were successfully evacuated, although tragically, one Ukrainian death was also reported during the conflict  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]). This period saw a significant international response to evacuate foreign nationals, with the United States  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 36]]) and other nations like India  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]) also organizing substantial evacuation efforts.

More recently, in 2024, amidst a deteriorating security and economic situation in Lebanon, Ukraine undertook multiple evacuation operations to bring its citizens home  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]). These operations were conducted through the collaborative efforts of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine (DIU) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]). Notably, these evacuation missions also assisted citizens of other countries, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Moldova, Brazil, and Lebanon  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]). The scale of these recent efforts involved the evacuation of 30 Ukrainians in August, 25 in September, 134 in October, and a further 68 in another October operation, resulting in a total of 257 Ukrainian citizens and 85 foreign nationals being evacuated by October 9, 2024  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]).

Furthermore, the provided materials indicate Ukrainian involvement in evacuation efforts during conflicts in Israel. Following the onset of the Gaza war in October 2023, Ukraine, like many other nations, sought to evacuate its citizens from Israel  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 42]]). Ukraine's ambassador to Israel reported that approximately 1,000 Ukrainian citizens had requested assistance with evacuation from Israel  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 43]]). The situation was further complicated by the presence of Ukrainian refugees in Israel who had previously fled the war in Ukraine  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 44]]). Earlier, in February 2022, as tensions escalated prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Israel was also actively working to evacuate its citizens from Ukraine  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 45]]).

**Analysis of Evidence and Key Findings**

The evidence gathered indicates a focused but significant role for Ukraine in security operations in Lebanon, primarily through its official military contribution to UNIFIL. The deployment of the 3rd Separate Engineering Battalion from 2000 to 2006 represents a substantial commitment to demining efforts along the tense border with Israel  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). The high praise received from UNIFIL leadership underscores the professionalism and effectiveness of this Ukrainian contingent  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]).

|**Year**|**Month**|**Number of Troops**|
|---|---|---|
|2001|December|638|
|---|---|---|
|2002|December|200|
|---|---|---|
|2003|June|194|
|---|---|---|

While official UN data lists a continued Ukrainian presence in UNIFIL after 2006 with 127 personnel  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]), there is no evidence within these materials to suggest significant Ukrainian military contributions within other national contingents (Polish, Italian, French) or the presence of Ukrainian private military companies during conflict escalations in Lebanon. Similarly, the participation of Ukrainian technical specialists or observers in international border monitoring missions along the Lebanon-Israel border is not documented in the provided snippets.

However, Ukraine has demonstrated a consistent commitment to the safety of its citizens in Lebanon through its active involvement in evacuation operations. During the 2006 Lebanon War, approximately 379 Ukrainians were evacuated  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]). More recently, in 2024, Ukraine conducted multiple evacuations, assisting a total of 257 Ukrainian citizens and 85 foreign nationals due to the deteriorating security and economic conditions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]).

|**Number of Ukrainians in Lebanon (Estimate)**|**Number of Ukrainians Evacuated**|**Number of Ukrainian Deaths**|
|---|---|---|
|1200|379|1|
|---|---|---|

|**Date of Evacuation**|**Number of Ukrainian Citizens Evacuated**|**Number of Foreign Citizens Evacuated**|
|---|---|---|
|August 3, 2024|30|0|
|---|---|---|
|September 4, 2024|25|0|
|---|---|---|
|October 1, 2024|134|45|
|---|---|---|
|October 9, 2024|28|40|
|---|---|---|

The evidence for Ukrainian involvement in security operations in Lebanon between 2000 and the present is primarily found in official UN reports regarding troop contributions and media reports detailing evacuation efforts. Information regarding Ukrainian personnel within other national contingents, PMC activities, and technical specialists in border missions is not readily available in these sources.

**Conclusion: Ukraine's Role in Lebanese Security Operations**

Ukraine's participation in security operations in Lebanon from 2000 to the present is characterized by a significant contribution to UNIFIL through the 3rd Separate Engineering Battalion, which played a vital role in demining the dangerous border region for six years. While direct evidence of other forms of Ukrainian military or security-related involvement is limited within this analysis, Ukraine has consistently demonstrated its responsibility towards its citizens in Lebanon by actively organizing and conducting evacuation operations during periods of conflict and instability, including the large-scale evacuations in 2006 and the more recent operations in 2024. This commitment to both international peacekeeping through its military engineers and the safety of its nationals underscores Ukraine's engagement with Lebanon's complex security environment.
