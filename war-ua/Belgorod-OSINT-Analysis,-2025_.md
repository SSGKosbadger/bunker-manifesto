**Analysis of Confirmed Ukrainian Military Actions:**

A significant military action during the analyzed period was the reported destruction of four Russian helicopters on March 24th, 2025 5. The Ukrainian Special Operations Forces (SSO) claimed responsibility for the strike, stating it was conducted in coordination with the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine (HUR), Rocket Forces, and Artillery 5. A HIMARS multiple-launch rocket system was reportedly employed to eliminate the aircraft, which included two Ka-52 attack helicopters and two Mi-8 transport helicopters 5. The helicopters were reportedly located at a field airstrip where they were undergoing maintenance, rearming, and refueling 9. The successful identification of the target site and the relaying of its coordinates to the HIMARS unit were attributed to the cooperation between the SSO and HUR 9. The use of M30A2 rockets, equipped with tungsten pellets for enhanced damage, suggests a deliberate effort to inflict maximum destruction on the targeted aircraft and potentially any nearby personnel or equipment 9. The estimated loss of $52 million further underscores the significance of this strike in degrading Russia's army aviation capabilities, which have already suffered considerable setbacks throughout the conflict 9. The Ka-52 "Alligator" attack helicopters are actively used by Russian forces for reconnaissance and precision strikes against Ukrainian forces, some equipped with long-range LMUR missiles 9. The Mi-8 transport helicopters are crucial for Russia's military logistics and troop deployments 9. Analysis of the strike footage reportedly indicates that the airstrip was either a temporary forward operating location or a regularly used Russian field airbase 9.

Furthermore, Ukrainian forces reportedly conducted strikes on Russian command and control infrastructure during the period. On March 20th, the Ukrainian General Staff reported the destruction of a Russian command post in the vicinity of Demidovka 1. This action was also reported by Kyiv Independent and RBC-Ukraine 2. The elimination of this command post was stated to significantly reduce the operational effectiveness of units belonging to the Third Motor Rifle Division of the Russian Federation's 20th Army 2. Additionally, on March 21st, the Ukrainian Air Force reportedly struck a command post of a Russian border outpost situated in Glotovo 1. The strike reportedly resulted in the destruction of communication equipment and other technical assets, aiming to weaken Russia's ability to conduct combat operations against Ukrainian Defense Forces in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions 7.

**Activity of Ukrainian Volunteer Units (RVC & LSR):**

The available information primarily indicates the involvement of regular Ukrainian military units in the reported operations within the Belgorod region between March 20th and 24th, 2025. While the Wikipedia entry on the 2025 Belgorod incursion mentions the confirmed operation of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade, a regular Ukrainian military formation, in the region, there is limited direct confirmation of significant activity by volunteer units such as the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) or the Freedom of Russia Legion (LSR) during this specific timeframe 1. The same source also identifies the 33rd Separate Assault Regiment and the 414th Strike UAV Brigade, both part of the regular Ukrainian military, as operating in Belgorod 1. An article from The Moscow Times, while discussing the RVC, does not place them within the Belgorod region during this period 21. Similarly, a reference in EADaily to the attack on Belgorod as a "meat assault" does not explicitly attribute it to the LSR 22. The Institute for the Study of War's assessment on March 23rd lists various Russian units reportedly operating in Belgorod Oblast but does not confirm the presence of either the RVC or the LSR 20. While the possibility of some involvement by these volunteer units cannot be entirely ruled out based solely on this data, the preponderance of evidence points towards the regular Ukrainian Armed Forces as the main participants in the confirmed military actions in Belgorod during this period.

**Targeting of Russian Military Infrastructure:**

While direct confirmation of Ukrainian attacks on fuel depots within the Belgorod region between March 20th and 24th, 2025, is absent from the provided data, there is evidence of a broader Ukrainian strategy targeting Russian fuel infrastructure. A fire at an oil depot in the Krasnodar Krai region, which continued for five days following a drone attack, suggests an ongoing effort to disrupt Russian logistics 23. Although this incident occurred outside Belgorod, it indicates a pattern of Ukrainian strikes against critical Russian fuel supplies. Previous reports from November 2024 mentioned an unconfirmed Ukrainian drone strike targeting an oil depot in Belgorod Oblast, suggesting that this region has been a target in the past 26.

Regarding military warehouses, the reported Ukrainian strike on the Engels Airbase in Saratov Oblast on March 20th resulted in the destruction of ammunition and weapons storage areas 3. This successful attack on a strategic Russian airbase, while geographically distant from Belgorod, demonstrates Ukraine's capability to target and inflict significant damage on Russian military storage facilities. Furthermore, the reported destruction of the Russian command post near Demidovka on March 20th can be considered an attack impacting a form of military warehousing, as command posts are integral to the storage and distribution of military resources and the coordination of operations 1.

The provided snippets do not contain specific reports of confirmed Ukrainian attacks directly targeting air defense systems within the Belgorod region between March 20th and 24th, 2025. However, a YouTube video dated March 18th mentions a large-scale Ukrainian attack on Russian radar detection and air defense systems in occupied Crimea 30. This indicates that Ukraine is actively seeking to degrade Russia's air defense capabilities in other regions, which would likely be a strategic objective in Belgorod as well to facilitate further operations.

**Corroboration from Independent News Outlets:**

While the provided research material does not contain direct links to specific reports from Reuters, BBC, and Associated Press (AP) exclusively covering the Ukrainian operations in Belgorod between March 20th and 24th, 2025, the widespread reporting of key events across numerous other sources strongly suggests likely corroboration by these major independent news organizations. The reported destruction of the four Russian helicopters on March 24th, for instance, was covered by a multitude of Ukrainian and international news outlets, including United24 Media, Kyiv Independent, Euromaidan Press, and BulgarianMilitary.com 9. This level of coverage indicates a high probability that major news agencies like Reuters, BBC, and AP also reported on this significant event. Additionally, United24 Media explicitly references Reuters in a report concerning US intelligence assessments regarding the situation in the Kursk region 31. Kyiv Independent, a prominent Ukrainian news source, frequently provides updates on the conflict, often drawing upon or aligning with information reported by these established international news agencies 2. To definitively confirm the extent of corroboration, a targeted search of the archives of Reuters, BBC, and AP for the specified period would be necessary. However, based on the available information, it is highly likely that these independent news outlets provided coverage of the significant Ukrainian military activities in the Belgorod region.

**Russian Response and Troop Movements:**

Russian authorities acknowledged significant Ukrainian military activity within the Belgorod region during the analyzed period. Officials confirmed an ongoing Ukrainian assault, with the situation being described as "difficult" 36. The governor of Belgorod Oblast reported instances of shelling and drone attacks, which resulted in both military and civilian casualties 1. In response to the reported incursions, the Krasnoyaruzhsky district was reportedly sealed off, with entry being restricted to local residents, indicating a serious security concern for the Russian administration in the region 36. Russian military sources claimed to have successfully repelled multiple Ukrainian attacks and asserted that they inflicted substantial casualties on the attacking forces 1. Furthermore, a Russian military blogger claimed that Russian forces managed to push Ukrainian troops back from the settlement of Demidovka 1. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has assessed that the Ukrainian operations in the Belgorod area are likely aimed at pinning down Russian military units and preventing their potential redeployment to other active frontlines within Ukraine 12. These statements and actions from the Russian side confirm that Ukrainian military operations during this period were significant enough to elicit a response at both the local and potentially strategic levels.

**Impact on Civilians and Infrastructure:**

The Ukrainian military operations in the Belgorod region between March 20th and 24th, 2025, reportedly had a direct impact on the civilian population and infrastructure. The Governor of Belgorod Oblast reported civilian casualties, including one death and two individuals wounded, as a result of Ukrainian drone strikes 1. Damage to civilian infrastructure was also reported, encompassing residential buildings and a gas supply line 17. Specifically, in the Krasny Oktyabr settlement, three private households and two cars were damaged by explosive devices dropped from a drone. In Borisovka, a social facility sustained damage due to shelling. A private house, an outbuilding, and a car were damaged in the Babka farm area by drone-dropped explosives. The village of Tishanka experienced significant damage, with two private houses, a garage and a car inside being destroyed by fire following shelling and a drone attack; the roof of the administrative building was also damaged. In Grayvoron, glazing in three apartments of an apartment building and four cars were damaged by explosive devices dropped from a drone. Shelling reportedly damaged the gas supply line serving Prilesye, Grafovka, Demidovka, Reliability, Popovka, and the Pervomaisky farm. In Bobrava, six private households, four cars, two social institutions, and two trade facilities were damaged by shelling. Additionally, a private house and two outbuildings were damaged in Murom by drone-dropped explosives 17. Furthermore, there were reports of civilian evacuations from certain settlements within the Krasnoyaruzhsky district, indicating a significant disruption to the lives of the local populace in the affected areas 38.

**Role of the Regular Ukrainian Armed Forces:**

The confirmed Ukrainian military actions in the Belgorod region during the analyzed period appear to have been primarily conducted by units of the regular Ukrainian Armed Forces. The reported destruction of the four Russian helicopters on March 24th was claimed by the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces (SSO) in coordination with other branches, including the HUR, Rocket Forces, and Artillery 5. This indicates a highly coordinated operation involving specialized units of the Ukrainian military. Furthermore, the Ukrainian Air Force reportedly conducted strikes on Russian command posts in the Belgorod region on multiple occasions between March 20th and 21st 1. Military expert Serhii Zgurets stated that Ukrainian forces advanced into Belgorod Oblast, with the involvement of units from Ukrainian assault battalions and individual brigades 11. The Wikipedia entry on the 2025 Belgorod incursion further corroborates this by mentioning the operational presence of specific regular Ukrainian military units, such as the 33rd Separate Assault Regiment, the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade, and the 414th Strike UAV Brigade, within the Belgorod region 1. This evidence collectively demonstrates that the Ukrainian military operations in Belgorod during this timeframe were not isolated incidents by volunteer groups but rather a coordinated effort involving various branches and units of the regular Ukrainian Armed Forces.

**Strategic Implications and Western Analysis:**

Assessments from Western think tanks, particularly the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), suggest that the Ukrainian military operations in the Belgorod region between March 20th and 24th, 2025, were likely undertaken with several strategic objectives in mind. One key objective appears to have been the disruption of potential Russian troop redeployments from the Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces had previously held territory 11. By conducting offensive actions in Belgorod, Ukraine aimed to pin down Russian units in the border region, preventing them from being transferred to other critical areas of the front 4. Military expert Serhii Zgurets further suggested that the operation aimed to preemptively counter any potential build-up of Russian troops along Ukraine's Sumy border, thereby preventing the opening of new fronts in that area 11. The successful HIMARS strike on Russian helicopters on March 24th also carries significant strategic implications, as it directly degrades Russia's army aviation capabilities, particularly those used for reconnaissance and ground attack missions, thus reducing the threat they pose to Ukrainian forces 9. While Defence Intelligence UK updates within the provided snippets primarily focus on broader trends in the conflict and Russian casualties, their reports highlighting the substantial losses suffered by Russia's armed forces provide context for the impact of Ukrainian actions in regions like Belgorod 43. Overall, the Ukrainian operations in Belgorod during this period appear to be a part of a broader strategy aimed at degrading Russian military capabilities, disrupting their operational plans, and protecting Ukrainian territory along the border.

**Conclusion:**

The open-source intelligence analysis of Ukrainian military operations in the Belgorod region of Russia between March 20th and 24th, 2025, reveals a period of significant activity characterized by targeted strikes and ground incursions. The confirmed HIMARS destruction of four Russian helicopters on March 24th stands out as a major success for Ukrainian forces, demonstrating their capability to strike high-value assets deep within Russian territory. Additionally, reported strikes on Russian command posts aimed to disrupt enemy command and control structures critical for operations near the Ukrainian border. While claims of involvement by Ukrainian volunteer units are limited, the evidence strongly suggests that these operations were primarily conducted by units of the regular Ukrainian Armed Forces, including the Special Operations Forces, Air Force, and Ground Forces. The strategic objectives of these actions likely included preventing Russian troop redeployments, preempting potential Russian offensives along the Sumy border, and degrading Russia's overall military capabilities. These operations have also had a tangible impact on the civilian population and infrastructure within the Belgorod region, resulting in reported casualties and damage. The Russian response indicates a serious concern regarding these Ukrainian activities, highlighting the continued escalation and expansion of the conflict's impact on border territories.
