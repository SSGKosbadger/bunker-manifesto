# **A Comparative Analysis of the Security of Major Messaging Applications**

**Introduction: The Landscape of Secure Messaging**

In an increasingly interconnected digital world, the security and privacy of communication have become paramount concerns for individuals and organizations alike. The reliance on messaging applications for daily interactions, ranging from personal conversations to sensitive business communications, necessitates a thorough understanding of the security measures implemented by these platforms. The potential risks associated with insecure communication, including data breaches, surveillance, and unauthorized access to personal information, underscore the critical need for users to be discerning about their choice of messaging application. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the security features offered by several popular messaging platforms, including Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, and other notable alternatives, to equip users with the knowledge to make informed decisions.

**Encryption Methods: A Deep Dive**

The cornerstone of secure messaging lies in the encryption methods employed by the applications to protect the confidentiality of user communications. Different messaging platforms utilize various encryption protocols, each with its own design principles and security characteristics.

**Telegram: MTProto and the Nuances of Secret Chats**

Telegram employs a custom encryption protocol known as MTProto, which, according to Telegram, is designed to secure communication between users and its servers  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). However, a critical aspect of Telegram's approach is that it does not use end-to-end encryption by default for all messages. Instead, standard chats rely on server-client encryption, meaning that while messages are encrypted between the user's device and Telegram's servers, Telegram technically has the capability to decrypt and read them  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). This design choice presents a fundamental difference from more secure end-to-end encrypted systems where even the service provider cannot access the content of messages.

For users seeking a higher level of security, Telegram offers a feature called Secret Chats. These chats utilize end-to-end encryption, employing an improved version of the MTProto protocol known as MTProto 2.0  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]). In Secret Chats, the encryption keys are generated and stored directly on the users' devices, ensuring that not even Telegram can decrypt these conversations  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]). However, Secret Chats come with significant limitations. They are only available for one-on-one conversations and not for group chats  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). Furthermore, Secret Chats are device-specific, meaning a conversation started on one device cannot be continued on another  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). Enabling Secret Chats also requires manual activation through multiple steps, a process that cryptography expert Matthew Green describes as "oddly difficult for non-expert users to actually do"  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). This complexity suggests that many users might inadvertently rely on the less secure default chats.

The MTProto protocol itself has faced scrutiny from cryptography experts. While it uses 2048-bit Diffie-Hellman key exchange for establishing shared secret keys, concerns have been raised about the implementation details. For instance, the protocol relies on the server to choose certain cryptographic parameters, which could introduce vulnerabilities if the server were compromised  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). Additionally, MTProto utilizes a unique encryption mode called Infinite Garble Extension (IGE), which is not widely adopted in the cryptographic community, raising further questions among experts who generally prefer more standard and thoroughly vetted approaches  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). While Telegram's MTProto protocol is open source, allowing security experts to review the code, the server-side code of Telegram is not publicly available, meaning that some aspects of its operation remain opaque to external review  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]). This dual approach to encryption in Telegram, with a less secure default and a more secure but limited option, indicates a trade-off between user convenience and maximum security.

**Signal: The Gold Standard of the Signal Protocol**

In contrast to Telegram, Signal employs the Signal Protocol, which is widely regarded as a highly secure and open-source protocol, by default for all communications  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). This includes text messages, voice and video calls, and group chats, ensuring end-to-end encryption across the board  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). Privacy is not an optional mode in Signal; it is the fundamental way the application works  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]).

The Signal Protocol combines several robust cryptographic primitives, including the Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and the Extended Triple Diffie–Hellman (X3DH) handshake  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]). It utilizes Curve25519 for elliptic curve cryptography, AES-256 for symmetric encryption, and HMAC-SHA256 for message authentication  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]). These components work together to provide a comprehensive set of security features, including confidentiality, ensuring only intended recipients can read messages; integrity, guaranteeing messages are not tampered with; authentication, verifying the identity of communicating parties; forward secrecy, protecting past communications even if current keys are compromised; and backward secrecy (also known as future secrecy), ensuring future communications remain secure even if past keys are compromised  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]). The Signal Protocol also supports end-to-end encrypted group chats using a combination of a pairwise double ratchet and multicast encryption  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]).

The strength and transparency of the Signal Protocol have led to its adoption by other major messaging platforms, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Skype, and Google Allo  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]). However, it's important to note that in some of these applications, the Signal Protocol is not enabled by default and is only available as an optional mode  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]). Signal's commitment to security is further reinforced by the fact that the complete source code for its clients and server is available on GitHub, allowing interested parties to examine the code for security and correctness  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]). Moreover, the Signal Protocol has undergone independent security audits by researchers, who have generally concluded that it is cryptographically sound  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]). Signal's consistent and default application of the well-regarded Signal Protocol across all communication types establishes it as a leading choice for secure messaging.

**WhatsApp: Leveraging the Signal Protocol**

Similar to Signal, WhatsApp also relies on the Signal Protocol to provide end-to-end encryption for its users  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 16]]). This means that by default, all personal messages, calls, photos, videos, voice messages, documents, status updates, and calls are secured with end-to-end encryption  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]). Users do not need to manually enable this feature; it is automatically active from the moment a message is sent  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]).

WhatsApp's implementation of the Signal Protocol involves several key aspects. Each device and conversation has its own unique set of encryption keys  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 17]]). When a message is sent, WhatsApp encrypts it using the recipient's public key, and it can only be decrypted by the recipient's private key, which is stored on their device  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 17]]). This process ensures that even WhatsApp itself cannot access the content of these messages  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 20]]). WhatsApp also offers optional end-to-end encrypted backups, providing an additional layer of security for stored data  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]). Users can manually verify the encryption of their chats using QR codes or 60-digit security numbers to confirm that no one is intercepting their communications  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]). The Signal Protocol's features like forward secrecy are also implemented in WhatsApp, ensuring that even if a key is compromised, it cannot decrypt past messages  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]).

While WhatsApp provides end-to-end encryption by default for personal communications, it's important to note that chats with businesses that use certain optional services to interact with customers might not be end-to-end encrypted  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 22]]). When businesses use these services, this is typically displayed clearly within the chat  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 22]]). Despite its use of the robust Signal Protocol, WhatsApp's security and privacy practices are often discussed in the context of its parent company, Meta, which also owns Facebook and Instagram. This association sometimes leads to user skepticism regarding the full extent of privacy offered on the platform  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 25]]).

**Other Notable Messengers: Encryption Approaches**

Beyond Telegram, Signal, and WhatsApp, several other messaging applications prioritize security and employ various encryption methods:

- **Wire:** Utilizes the Proteus protocol, which is their implementation of the Axolotl/Double Ratchet protocol (also used in Signal), for end-to-end encryption. It uses cryptographic primitives such as ChaCha20 stream cipher, HMAC-SHA256 for message authentication, Curve25519 for key exchange, and HKDF for key derivation  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). End-to-end encryption is always enabled by default for all communications, including messages, calls, and file sharing  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 27]]). Wire also uses SRTP with DTLS for encrypting audio and video calls  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 27]]).
- **Threema:** Employs the tried-and-tested open-source NaCl cryptography library  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]). All communication, including group messages, photos, videos, files, calls, and even status messages, is always end-to-end encrypted by default  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]). Threema uses asymmetric encryption based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography and also implements Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) through its "Ibex" protocol for an added layer of security  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]).
- **Session:** Uses the Session Protocol, which is built upon the highly audited and widely trusted libsodium cryptographic library, providing end-to-end encryption by default  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 36]]). A key feature of Session is its use of onion routing, similar to Tor, which helps to protect user metadata and ensure that no single server knows both the origin and destination of a message  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 37]]). Voice and video calls in Session are also end-to-end encrypted, although they currently use peer-to-peer networking rather than the onion routing used for messages  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 37]]).
- **Briar:** Is designed as a peer-to-peer messaging application that does not rely on central servers, making it highly resistant to censorship and surveillance  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]). It uses direct, encrypted connections between users' devices via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or the internet (Tor network) with end-to-end encryption enabled by default for all communication  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]). Briar utilizes the Bramble protocol suite, specifically designed for delay-tolerant networks  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 45]]).
- **Viber:** Offers end-to-end encryption by default for one-on-one chats and calls, group chats, and private media sharing  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 46]]). The encryption keys are stored only on the users' devices, ensuring that even Viber itself does not have access to them  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 50]]).
- **Matrix (via Element):** Employs the Olm and Megolm protocols, which are implementations of the Double Ratchet protocol popularized by Signal, to provide end-to-end encryption  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 51]]). While one-to-one calls are end-to-end encrypted by default, encryption for rooms (group chats) is not enabled by default and must be manually activated per room  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 53]]).

The variety of encryption methods and default settings across these messaging platforms highlights the diverse approaches taken to balance security, usability, and functionality.

**Default End-to-End Encryption: Privacy from the Outset**

The default status of end-to-end encryption in a messaging application is a critical factor in determining the baseline level of privacy and security that users can expect.

**Telegram: E2EE as an Option, Not the Standard**

As previously mentioned, standard Telegram chats do not benefit from end-to-end encryption by default  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]). Users who wish to have this added layer of security must manually initiate a Secret Chat  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). This opt-in approach means that the vast majority of everyday Telegram conversations are likely not end-to-end encrypted. The limitations of Secret Chats, such as being restricted to one-on-one conversations and specific devices, further underscore that end-to-end encryption is not the standard for Telegram users  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). Relying on server-client encryption for default chats carries potential security risks, as Telegram itself has the technical capability to access these messages  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]).

**Signal: End-to-End Encryption Across All Communications**

In stark contrast, Signal provides end-to-end encryption by default for all forms of communication offered on the platform  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]). This includes private and group chats, as well as voice and video calls. Privacy is integral to Signal's design, ensuring that all user communications are protected from the moment they are sent without requiring any manual activation or special settings  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]). This commitment to default end-to-end encryption distinguishes Signal from Telegram, where the most secure form of communication is an optional feature  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 12]]).

**WhatsApp: E2EE by Default with Specific Considerations**

WhatsApp also offers end-to-end encryption by default for all personal communications conducted through the app  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]). This includes text messages, media files, voice notes, and calls. The encryption is automatically applied, and users do not need to take any extra steps to secure their conversations  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]). However, as noted earlier, there are specific scenarios, such as communication with certain business accounts using optional services, where end-to-end encryption might not be in place  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 22]]). Additionally, while WhatsApp provides default E2EE, some users may harbor skepticism due to the platform's ownership by Meta and the associated data collection practices  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 25]]).

**Default E2EE in Other Popular Messengers**

Many other secure messaging alternatives have adopted the practice of enabling end-to-end encryption by default:

- **Wire:** Features always-on end-to-end encryption for all messages, calls, and file sharing  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 27]]).
- **Threema:** Ensures that all messages, calls, and media are end-to-end encrypted by default  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]).
- **Session:** Provides default end-to-end encryption for all conversations conducted on the platform  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]).
- **Briar:** Due to its decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture, end-to-end encryption is inherently enabled by default for all communication  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]).
- **Viber:** Uses end-to-end encryption by default for the majority of communication types offered on the app  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 47]]).
- **Matrix (via Element):** While one-to-one calls are end-to-end encrypted by default, encryption for group chats (rooms) requires manual activation  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 53]]).

The prevalence of default end-to-end encryption among many secure messaging apps indicates a growing recognition of its importance in protecting user privacy from the outset. Matrix's approach of optional encryption for rooms suggests a different design philosophy that prioritizes flexibility.

**Recent Security Vulnerabilities and Exploits: A Timely Examination**

Staying informed about recent security vulnerabilities and exploits associated with messaging applications is crucial for understanding the real-world risks they might pose to users.

**Telegram: Vulnerabilities, Data Sharing, and Ongoing Scrutiny**

In recent times, Telegram has been subject to scrutiny regarding its security. A vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-7014 in the Android application could allow attackers to execute malicious code through disguised multimedia files due to improper file attachment handling  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 60]]). Over the years, Telegram has also experienced several data breaches that have exposed millions of users' sensitive information  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 61]]). Concerns persist regarding Telegram's practice of storing decryption keys for standard chats on its servers, which could grant access to user data if the servers were compromised  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 61]]).

The arrest of Telegram's CEO in 2024 was followed by a reported increase in the platform's sharing of user data with authorities, raising concerns about its commitment to privacy  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 61]]). Additionally, Telegram has been noted to have a problem with phishing schemes within the platform, where malicious actors attempt to trick users into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 61]]). These incidents and concerns highlight the importance of users being aware of the potential security risks associated with using Telegram.

**Signal: Security Incidents and the Importance of User Awareness**

While the Signal Protocol is considered robust, Signal has also faced security-related incidents. A leaked Pentagon memo in March 2025 warned of Russian hackers attempting to breach Signal chats by exploiting the "linked devices" feature through the use of malicious QR codes  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 65]]). This exploit allowed attackers to secretly sync a victim's chats to a hacker-controlled device by manipulating them into scanning a QR code  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 65]]). It's crucial to understand that this vulnerability bypassed Signal's encryption by exploiting device authorization, rather than breaking the encryption itself  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 65]]).

The National Security Agency (NSA) also issued warnings about vulnerabilities in Signal, specifically related to phishing scams that target Signal users  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 67]]). These scams aim to trick users into revealing sensitive information. In 2023, researchers discovered a method to potentially track a Signal user's location by measuring the time between sending a message and receiving a delivery notification  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 69]]). These incidents underscore that while Signal's underlying encryption is strong, vulnerabilities can still arise from the implementation of the application and from user behavior, such as falling victim to phishing attacks. Even on highly secure platforms, user awareness and caution remain essential.

**WhatsApp: Vulnerabilities and the Threat Landscape**

Despite its reliance on the secure Signal Protocol, WhatsApp has also experienced its share of security vulnerabilities. In 2022, several vulnerabilities were disclosed, including CVE-2022-36934 and CVE-2022-27492, both of which were integer overflow/underflow issues that could lead to remote code execution during video calls or when receiving crafted video files  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 70]]). Earlier, in 2021, CVE-2021-24043 and CVE-2021-24042 were identified as missing bound check and out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities that could be exploited during calls involving malicious actors  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 70]]).

Reports have also emerged detailing a WhatsApp vulnerability that could allow governments to see who users are messaging  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 71]]). Furthermore, WhatsApp has been identified as a target for spyware attacks, with instances of journalists and activists being targeted  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 71]]). Additionally, vulnerabilities have been found in WhatsApp plugins for WordPress, potentially allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 72]]). These incidents highlight that even applications using strong encryption protocols are susceptible to vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors.

**Threema, Wire, Session, and Briar: Recent Security Findings**

Other secure messaging apps have also had recent security findings:

- **Threema:** In 2023, a crypto audit revealed several cryptographic vulnerabilities in Threema's previous communication protocol. These issues have since been addressed, and Threema has transitioned to a new, more robust protocol called "Ibex"  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 75]]). An audit of Threema's desktop application in January 2024 by Cure53 identified several vulnerabilities, ranging from low to medium severity, including a denial-of-service risk via SVG inline previews and insecure web preferences  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 78]]).
- **Wire:** In June 2021, an XSS flaw was discovered in the Wire messaging app that could have allowed attackers to gain full control of user accounts. This vulnerability was promptly patched by Wire's maintainers  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 79]]). In November 2022, a high-severity vulnerability was found in the OpenSSL library, which Wire uses in its web and desktop clients. However, Wire confirmed that its server components and mobile clients were not affected by this specific vulnerability  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 80]]).
- **Session:** In January 2025, a security researcher published claims about potential insufficient entropy in Session's Ed25519 key generation. Session's developers responded to these claims, asserting that their key generation process is secure and was explicitly reviewed during a security audit by Quarkslab  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 81]]). Quarkslab's audit of Session's Android, iOS, and Desktop clients found a few low-impact issues, primarily related to design choices, and one severe issue on Android concerning TLS verification, which has since been fixed  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 37]]).
- **Briar:** In May 2023, security researchers at ETH Zürich reported three security issues in the Briar app. Two of these, a denial-of-service vulnerability caused by receiving invalid messages and a message duplication issue in blogs, forums, and private groups, were fixed in Briar version 1.4.22. The third issue, related to inadequate encryption strength in the Bramble Handshake Protocol and missing authorization for public keys, was addressed in version 1.5.3  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 83]]). A security audit conducted by Radically Open Security between September 2023 and March 2024 identified six security issues, ranging from moderate to low risk, including potential overlay attacks on Android and vulnerabilities related to Wi-Fi sharing and TCP communication. Four of these issues were resolved by the Briar team, with plans to address the remaining two in future updates  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 86]]).

These recent findings across various secure messaging platforms highlight the ongoing need for vigilance, security audits, and timely patching to ensure the safety of user communications.

**Metadata Handling: The Often-Overlooked Aspect of Privacy**

While encryption focuses on securing the content of messages, metadata – information about the communication, such as who is communicating, when, and how often – can also reveal a great deal about users' activities and relationships  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]). The way messaging applications handle metadata is a critical aspect of user privacy.

**Telegram: Metadata Collection and Implications**

Telegram collects various types of metadata from its users. This includes the user's phone number, which serves as their unique identifier, as well as their chosen username, profile picture, and any bio information they choose to share  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]). Telegram also records timestamps indicating when messages are sent and received, the size of messages, the type of content shared (text, images, videos), and the frequency of a user's interactions with others  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 87]]). Device information, such as the operating system, device model, and application version, is also collected  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 87]]). Additionally, Telegram may log a user's IP address and collect data related to their usage patterns, including how often they use the app and which features they engage with  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]). It's important to note that this metadata is not protected by end-to-end encryption in standard Telegram chats  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]). Telegram's privacy policy states that it may store certain metadata, such as IP addresses, for up to 12 months and may share it with third parties if presented with a warrant  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 61]]). Furthermore, usernames and profile pictures on Telegram are always public  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 90]]). The collection of this significant amount of metadata by Telegram, while serving various functional and security purposes, can also be valuable for surveillance and analysis, making it a consideration for users who prioritize privacy.

**Signal: Minimizing Metadata Exposure**

In contrast, Signal is designed with a core principle of minimizing the collection of sensitive information and metadata about its users  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). Unlike many other messaging services, Signal does not store metadata about user communications, such as contact lists, message timestamps, or user profiles, on its servers  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). Signal employs a feature called "Sealed Sender," which conceals the sender's identity even from Signal's own servers, further reducing the amount of metadata that could be captured  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 92]]). According to its privacy policy, the only metadata that Signal retains is the date an account was created and the last time the app was used  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 11]]). Profile information, such as names and pictures, is also end-to-end encrypted  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 69]]). This strong focus on minimizing metadata exposure is a key aspect of Signal's commitment to user privacy.

**WhatsApp: Metadata and its Connection to the Meta Ecosystem**

While the content of WhatsApp messages is end-to-end encrypted, the application does collect a substantial amount of metadata about its users  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 20]]). This includes a user's profile information, their contacts, details about when and for how long they use the app, who they are communicating with, and information about their device, such as battery level and operating system  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 94]]). WhatsApp also logs users' IP addresses, which can be used to estimate their location, even if location-related features are turned off  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 95]]). Furthermore, WhatsApp collects network details, browser information, ISP details, and other identifiers that are linked to other Meta products, such as Instagram and Facebook  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 94]]). A significant privacy concern for many users is that WhatsApp shares this metadata with its parent company, Meta  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 26]]). Security researchers have also identified the potential for correlation attacks, where a sophisticated analysis of encrypted data, combined with its associated metadata, could potentially compromise the app's privacy protections  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 95]]). While WhatsApp has introduced features aimed at minimizing some data collection, such as the option to hide IP addresses during calls and disable link previews, the extent of metadata collected and shared remains a key consideration for privacy-conscious users  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 95]]).

**Metadata Strategies in Other Privacy-Focused Messengers**

Other secure messaging apps handle metadata in various ways, reflecting their different privacy philosophies:

- **Wire:** Collects a minimal amount of data necessary to synchronize conversations across devices and for troubleshooting. It does not sell analytics or usage data to third parties and uses transport encryption to secure metadata  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). Wire stores device-specific metadata to enhance notification clarity, such as the device class, model, a user-defined label, a cookie label for authentication, and the UTC timestamp of device registration  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 27]]).
- **Threema:** Is designed with a strong emphasis on avoiding metadata generation and storage. Messages and media files are transmitted without any permanent storage on servers and are deleted immediately after successful delivery. Threema does not store contact lists on its servers; if users opt for contact synchronization, phone numbers and email addresses are anonymized (hashed) before being temporarily sent to the server for matching and then immediately deleted. The platform does not keep logs about who is communicating with whom and can be used anonymously without requiring a phone number or email address  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]).
- **Session:** Prioritizes minimizing sensitive metadata collection. It does not collect any geolocation data, information about the user's network, or details about the device being used. Session employs onion routing to hide users' IP addresses from both other users and the servers that store the data  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]). User accounts on Session are completely anonymous and do not require a phone number or email address for registration  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 40]]).
- **Briar:** Is designed to resist metadata surveillance. It uses the Tor network to prevent eavesdroppers from learning which users are communicating with each other. Each user's contact list is encrypted and stored solely on their own device. Due to its decentralized design, there are no central servers to collect and store metadata about user communications  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]).
- **Viber:** Collects a variety of metadata, including identifiers, the user's phone address book (if access is granted), geolocation data, device-specific information, data about user activity within the app (such as interactions with communities and bots), and inferred data about user interests and demographics  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 46]]). While Viber states that it does not read or listen to the content of private chats and calls and does not store delivered messages, its metadata collection is more extensive compared to some other secure messaging apps  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 50]]). Viber does offer privacy settings that allow users to control certain aspects of data collection and usage  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 102]]).
- **Matrix (via Element):** While Matrix encrypts the transport of data to and from the home server and allows for end-to-end encryption of messages and calls  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 54]]), the specific details of its metadata handling practices require further examination within the provided research snippets to provide a comprehensive overview.

The diverse approaches to metadata handling among these messaging apps underscore the different priorities and design choices made by each platform regarding user privacy.

**Privacy Policy Analysis: Promises and Practices**

The privacy policy of a messaging application outlines how the platform collects, uses, and shares user data. Analyzing these policies is essential for understanding a service's commitments to user privacy.

**Telegram's Privacy Policy: Balancing Functionality and Data Use**

Telegram's privacy policy states two fundamental principles: it does not use user data to show ads, and it only stores the data necessary for the service to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging platform  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 90]]). The legal basis for processing user data is identified as Telegram's legitimate interests, which include providing effective services and addressing security issues  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 90]]). The policy details the types of personal data collected, as discussed in the metadata section, including phone number, username, contacts, messages (stored encrypted in the cloud for cloud chats, not stored for secret chats), and IP addresses  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 90]]). Telegram distinguishes between cloud chats, which are stored on its servers for multi-device access, and secret chats, which are end-to-end encrypted and not stored on servers  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 90]]). The policy mentions that cookies are only used for operating the web-based services and not for profiling or advertising  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 90]]). Telegram's default account deletion policy removes inactive accounts (and associated data) after 18 months, although users can customize this period  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 90]]). The platform also has a separate privacy policy for bots and mini apps  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 107]]). Some users have reported inconsistencies between Telegram's stated privacy policy and its actual practices, particularly regarding account deletion and contact handling  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 106]]).

**Signal's Privacy Policy: A Commitment to Minimal Data Retention**

Signal's privacy policy emphasizes its commitment to never collecting or storing any sensitive information. It states that Signal messages and calls are always end-to-end encrypted and cannot be accessed by Signal or other third parties  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 15]]). The policy confirms that Signal cannot decrypt or otherwise access the content of user messages or calls  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 69]]). Account registration requires a phone number, and users can optionally add a profile name and picture, which are end-to-end encrypted  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 69]]). Signal can optionally discover which contacts in a user's address book are also Signal users by using cryptographically hashed phone numbers, a process designed to protect the privacy of contacts  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 108]]). The policy explicitly states that Signal does not sell, rent, or monetize user data in any way  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 108]]). Signal's privacy policy also addresses GDPR compliance and provides contact information for its Data Protection Officer  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 109]]). The overall tone and content of Signal's privacy policy strongly reflect its mission to prioritize user privacy through minimal data retention and robust encryption.

**WhatsApp's Privacy Policy: Navigating Business Features and Data Sharing**

WhatsApp's privacy policy indicates that personal chats with friends and family remain protected by end-to-end encryption, and neither WhatsApp nor its parent company, Meta, can read or listen to them  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 110]]). Policy updates in recent years have primarily focused on providing more clarity regarding how WhatsApp collects, shares, and uses data, particularly in relation to optional business features  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 110]]). WhatsApp states that it does not keep logs of who everyone is messaging or calling and does not share users' contact lists with Meta for advertising purposes  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 110]]). However, the policy details various categories of information that are automatically collected, including usage information, log and troubleshooting data, device and connection information (such as IP address), general location information, cookies, user choices regarding settings, and authentication information  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 96]]). The policy acknowledges that Meta may use the way users interact with ads that lead to messaging a business on WhatsApp to personalize the ads they see on Facebook or Instagram  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 110]]). While WhatsApp offers features like disappearing messages and optional encrypted backups to enhance privacy, its privacy policy reflects a balance between providing secure personal communication and enabling business interactions that involve data sharing within the Meta ecosystem.

**Privacy Policies of Alternative Secure Messaging Apps**

The privacy policies of other secure messaging applications further illustrate the diverse approaches to user data:

- **Wire:** Their privacy policy states that they do not rent or sell user data to third parties, nor is user data used for targeted advertising or profiling  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 97]]). Wire collects only the minimal data necessary to synchronize conversations across devices and for troubleshooting, including IP address, website access information, browser details, and operating system  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 27]]). The company is transparent about the data it collects and what it is used for. Wire's operations are based in Switzerland, and it complies with both EU data protection laws (GDPR) and Swiss data protection law (FADP)  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 27]]).
- **Threema:** The privacy policy of Threema emphasizes its principle of avoiding metadata to the largest extent possible. Messages and media files are transmitted without any storage on Threema's servers and are deleted immediately after successful delivery  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 98]]). The app does not require an email address or phone number and can be used anonymously. Threema does not store contact lists on its servers; if users opt for synchronization, the data is hashed and processed temporarily. The company states that it does not create any log files whatsoever about who is communicating with whom. Threema Work, the business version, is fully compliant with GDPR, and as a Swiss company, Threema is also subject to Switzerland's strict Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP)  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]).
- **Session:** Session's privacy policy clearly states that the app never knows who users are, who they are talking to, or the content of their messages  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 100]]). Session is designed so that it does not store any information that could be used to track users. The app does not collect or share identifying information about a user's device, such as IP address or user agent, and does not require a phone number, email, or any information tied to a real identity to create an account. This privacy-by-default approach aims to ensure user anonymity and privacy  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 100]]).
- **Briar:** The privacy policy of Briar states that they do not have access to the content or metadata of user communications via the app and will not modify the app to enable such access for themselves or anyone else  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 116]]). Briar does not collect any information about how the app is used or who uses it, with limited exceptions for website logs (deleted after seven days) and feedback or crash reports that users voluntarily choose to send  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 116]]). Feedback and crash reports are encrypted before being sent to Briar's developers. The policy emphasizes that any information sent by users will only be used to improve the Briar app, and email addresses provided for feedback or crash reports will not be shared or used for other purposes  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 116]]).
- **Viber:** Viber's privacy policy outlines the types of data it collects, including identifiers, contact information (if access is granted), geolocation data, device information, activity data, and inferences about users  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 50]]). While Viber clarifies that it does not read, listen to, or store the content of private messages and calls once they are delivered, it does use the collected data for various purposes, including contacting users with marketing and offers related to Viber and its partners, personalizing content, and providing localized services  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 50]]). Viber provides users with privacy settings to manage certain aspects of data collection and usage  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 102]]).
- **Matrix (via Element):** A thorough analysis of the provided snippets is needed to fully understand the privacy policy of Matrix and Element. However, it is noted that Matrix encrypts transports to and from the home server and allows for end-to-end encryption  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 54]]).

The privacy policies of these alternative messaging apps reveal a spectrum of approaches to data handling, with some platforms prioritizing extreme data minimization and anonymity, while others collect more information for enhanced functionality and personalization.

**Independent Security Audits: Verifying Trustworthiness**

Independent security audits play a crucial role in verifying the trustworthiness and security claims of messaging applications.
