# **Tracing the Evolution of Activist Infrastructure: From Past US Protest Movements to 2025 Mobilizations**

**I. Introduction**

Understanding the infrastructure that underpins activist movements is crucial for analyzing their capacity to effect societal and political change. This infrastructure encompasses the web of organizations, leaders, financial resources, communication networks, and strategic approaches that enable collective action. This report examines the evolution of activist infrastructure in the United States by tracing the trajectories of three significant protest movements: the Women's March, Black Lives Matter (BLM), and Occupy Wall Street. By analyzing the key organizations and figures involved, their funding sources, the collaborations they forged, and their utilization of online platforms, this report aims to illuminate the continuities and transformations in activist infrastructure from these past movements to potential large-scale mobilizations anticipated in 2025. A comprehensive understanding of this evolution is essential for anticipating the nature, scope, and potential impact of contemporary and future activist endeavors.

Activist infrastructure can be defined as the interconnected system that facilitates the mobilization and sustainability of social movements. This system includes formal and informal organizations that coordinate actions and advocate for change; prominent leaders who articulate the movement's goals and inspire participation; funding sources that provide the necessary resources for organizing and operations; networks that enable communication and collaboration among activists and groups; digital tools and platforms that facilitate outreach and mobilization; and shared strategies and tactics that guide the movement's actions. Examining these components across different movements and time periods reveals the dynamic nature of activist infrastructure and its adaptation to evolving social and political landscapes.

The Women's March, which reached its peak in 2017, emerged as a powerful mobilization advocating for women's rights and resistance to the incoming Trump administration. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Black Lives Matter, gaining prominence in 2013 and surging in 2020, focused on combating systemic racism and police brutality against Black people. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) Occupy Wall Street, which began in 2011, brought attention to economic inequality and corporate influence in government. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]) These three movements represent distinct yet often overlapping strands of activism in the US, each with its own organizational structures, leadership styles, and approaches to mobilizing support and achieving their goals. Analyzing their infrastructure and the connections between them provides valuable insights into the broader landscape of social and political activism in the nation.

As the year 2025 unfolds, various potential large-scale mobilizations are being planned and anticipated, often in response to ongoing political and social issues. Understanding the legacy of past movements, the evolution of their infrastructure, and the extent to which organizations and leaders from these movements are involved in current activities is crucial for anticipating the characteristics and potential impact of these future mobilizations. This report will delve into these aspects, providing a comprehensive analysis of the evolving landscape of activist infrastructure in the United States.

**II. The Women's March: Genesis and Infrastructure**

The genesis of the Women's March in 2017 can be traced back to a Facebook post by Teresa Shook, expressing a desire for a march on Washington, D.C., following the election of Donald Trump in November 2016. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) This initial call resonated widely, quickly gaining traction and demonstrating the power of social media platforms to facilitate the rapid formation of collective intent and action. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]) The spontaneous nature of this initial mobilization, bypassing traditional organizational hierarchies, highlights a notable shift in how contemporary social movements can emerge and gain momentum in the digital age. Unlike earlier movements that often relied on established organizations for their inception, the Women's March showcased the potential for online platforms to catalyze widespread activism from a groundswell of individual concerns.

Several key organizing entities played crucial roles in shaping and executing the Women's March. The Women's March Network, initially a project of NEO Philanthropy, later became a standalone feminist activist group. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]) Rachel O'Leary Carmona serves as the executive director of this network, which focuses on organizing members and employing them in various activist campaigns. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]) The transition of the Women's March Network from a fiscally sponsored project to an independent organization in April 2021  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]) suggests a significant step in its organizational development, likely driven by the need for greater autonomy in managing its finances and directing its strategic initiatives for long-term sustainability and broader impact. This evolution indicates a maturation process common in successful activist groups as they seek to solidify their infrastructure and expand their capacity for action.

The National Organization for Women (NOW), founded in 1966, also played a significant role as a premier partner of the Women's March. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) As the largest organization of feminist grassroots activists in the United States, NOW brought to the march its extensive history of organizing mass demonstrations for women's rights, along with its established network of hundreds of chapters and hundreds of thousands of members and activists across all 50 states. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]) The involvement of NOW, a long-standing organization with a well-developed infrastructure, underscores the continuity of feminist activism across different generations and the crucial role that established organizations can play in supporting and amplifying the reach of newer movements. NOW's participation provided the Women's March with valuable experience in large-scale event planning and access to a pre-existing base of committed activists.

The initial organization of the 2017 Women's March was spearheaded by four co-chairs: Linda Sarsour, Tamika Mallory, Carmen Perez, and Bob Bland. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) These women brought diverse backgrounds and experiences in activism and community organizing, which was a deliberate effort to ensure broad representation across different racial, ethnic, and social identities within the movement. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) This emphasis on diversity in leadership reflects a key characteristic of contemporary social movements that strive for inclusivity and aim to address the interconnectedness of various forms of marginalization. Their collective leadership was instrumental in mobilizing participants and shaping the initial message and goals of the march.

Serving as honorary co-chairs were prominent figures in social justice movements, including Gloria Steinem, Harry Belafonte, LaDonna Harris, Angela Davis, and Dolores Huerta. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) Their involvement lent significant symbolic weight and decades of experience to the Women's March, providing it with enhanced credibility and public recognition. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) By associating with these iconic figures from past struggles for civil rights and feminist causes, the Women's March sought to legitimize its own efforts and connect its goals to a broader historical context of social justice activism, thereby strengthening its moral authority and inspiring greater participation.

Furthermore, the Women's March garnered support from a wide array of partner organizations, including Planned Parenthood, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the AFL-CIO, Amnesty International USA, the NAACP, and many others. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) These partnerships provided the march with crucial staff, resources, and access to diverse constituencies, indicating a broad coalition of interests united by shared concerns regarding women's rights and other related social justice issues. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) The involvement of such a diverse range of organizations, from labor unions to environmental groups to civil rights advocates, highlights the interconnectedness of various progressive causes and the potential for wide-ranging support and mobilization capacity when these groups collaborate on common objectives.

The funding of the Women's March evolved over time, reflecting its growth and increasing organizational complexity. In its initial year, the movement raised over $2.5 million, primarily through fundraising events. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]) This early reliance on event-based fundraising was crucial for generating initial capital and fostering a sense of community and engagement among early supporters. As the movement grew, its funding sources diversified. In 2017, the Women's March organization reported a total revenue of $45 million, with a significant portion, $38 million, coming from individual donors, indicating a strong base of public support. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]) An additional $6 million was received from foundation grants, suggesting that the movement's objectives resonated with the missions of various philanthropic organizations. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]])

However, the Women's March also had financial ties to less transparent sources. The 2019 Women's March, for instance, had financial supporters linked to "dark money" groups, including the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and the Center for Popular Democracy Action. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]) "Dark money" refers to funds spent on political campaigns by non-profit organizations that do not disclose their donors. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 10]]) This connection raises concerns about the transparency of the movement's funding and the potential influence of undisclosed donors on its agenda and operations. The involvement of such politically active non-profits indicates a growing trend of social movements being supported by organizations with broader political aims.

The Women's March also utilized online platforms for fundraising, with ActBlue serving as a key conduit for individual donations. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 11]]) ActBlue is a platform designed to facilitate charitable giving for progressive causes, making it easier for individuals to contribute small amounts to support the movement's activities and aligning with a grassroots fundraising model. Furthermore, the Women's March established a political action committee, Women's March Win PAC, which received $115,645 in contributions during the 2024 election cycle. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 12]]) Notably, the majority of these funds, 99.74%, came from other PACs, with only a small percentage from individual donors. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 12]]) This signifies a strategic move towards more direct political engagement through campaign finance, indicating an intention to influence electoral outcomes and support candidates aligned with the movement's goals. The high proportion of funding from other PACs suggests a network of interconnected political organizations contributing to the Women's March's political arm. The multifaceted funding strategy of the Women's March, encompassing grassroots donations, foundation support, and political action committee funding, reflects its evolution into a significant political force.

From its inception, the Women's March adopted a collaborative approach, evident in the numerous organizational partnerships formed for the initial 2017 march. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) This broad network of premier partners and partner organizations demonstrated the movement's ability to build extensive coalitions across various sectors of civil society, amplifying its reach and impact by working with diverse groups united by shared values and goals. This collaborative spirit extended to specific campaigns as well. For example, the Women's March joined forces with groups like UltraViolet, the National Women's Law Center (NWLC), and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) for the "Women's Wave Day of Action" to advocate for reproductive rights. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 13]]) These issue-specific alliances highlight a strategic approach to mobilizing collective action around particular policy objectives, leveraging the expertise and resources of partner organizations to achieve targeted outcomes.

Despite these collaborations, the Women's March also faced challenges in maintaining unity and fostering inclusive relationships with other movements. Notably, there have been documented tensions and criticisms from Black Lives Matter (BLM) chapters regarding the Women's March's approach to intersectionality and its fulfillment of commitments to local BLM organizations. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 14]]) These tensions, such as those highlighted in an open letter from BLM DC  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 14]]), reveal the complexities of building and sustaining broad coalitions across different social justice movements and the ongoing need for accountability and genuine engagement with the diverse needs and perspectives of all constituent groups. These challenges underscore the potential for fragmentation within the broader progressive activist space and the importance of continuous dialogue and efforts to build trust and solidarity.

Acknowledging the broader historical context of social justice activism, the Women's March platform explicitly honored the legacy of movements like Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 16]]) This recognition suggests an awareness of shared goals and a desire to situate the Women's March within a larger tradition of activism, drawing legitimacy and inspiration from previous struggles for social change. This acknowledgement of legacy movements indicates an understanding of the interconnectedness of various social justice issues and an attempt to build upon the work of those who came before.

Looking towards the future, the Women's March has continued to engage in collaborative efforts. It is listed as a leading organization for the "Hands Off!" protests scheduled for April 5, 2025, alongside other prominent progressive groups like MoveOn and Indivisible. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]) This participation demonstrates the Women's March's ongoing role in large-scale mobilizations and its alignment with a broader coalition of organizations opposing the Trump administration. Furthermore, the Women's March is collaborating with the 50501 Movement for the People's Veto Day, also on April 5, 2025. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 20]]) This specific partnership indicates a focused effort on mobilizing against particular political moments or policy initiatives, highlighting the strategic use of alliances to achieve targeted goals. While the Women's March has engaged in significant collaborations, particularly within the broader progressive and anti-Trump administration spaces, its relationships with other movements like BLM have faced complexities. The acknowledgment of legacy movements suggests a recognition of shared history and goals, even amidst ongoing challenges in coalition building.

**III. Black Lives Matter Movement: Formation and Network**

The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement originated in 2013 as a powerful hashtag (#BlackLivesMatter) created by three radical Black organizers—Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi—in direct response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) This digital genesis underscores the transformative role of social media platforms in contemporary movement building, demonstrating how online tools can rapidly galvanize collective action and forge a sense of shared identity and purpose among individuals connected by common grievances and a desire for social change. The speed and reach of the hashtag's dissemination allowed for a decentralized and immediate formation of a collective voice, bypassing the traditional structures and timelines often associated with the establishment of formal organizations.

A defining characteristic of the BLM movement is its decentralized network structure. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 24]]) While specific organizations operate under the banner of "Black Lives Matter," such as the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF), the broader movement lacks a formal hierarchy and operates as a loose confederation of groups and individuals advocating for racial justice. This decentralized model distinguishes BLM from more traditional, top-down social movements, allowing for greater local autonomy and the emergence of diverse approaches to activism tailored to the specific needs and contexts of different communities. This structure fosters grassroots engagement and empowers local chapters to address issues of racial injustice in ways that are most relevant to their own experiences.

The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF) was formed in 2013 by Garza, Cullors, and Tometi and serves as a central fundraising and grant-making body for the broader movement. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 24]]) BLMGNF also owns the domain name "blacklivesmatter.com," establishing a significant online hub for information and resources related to the movement. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 25]]) This foundation plays a crucial role in providing financial and infrastructural support to the decentralized network of BLM activists and local chapters, enabling resource sharing and facilitating coordinated actions at a national and even global level. While the movement's strength lies in its distributed nature, BLMGNF provides a vital organizational backbone for sustaining and amplifying its impact.

Several key figures were instrumental in the formation and early development of the BLM movement. Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi are widely recognized as the founders who initiated the movement with the original hashtag. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) Their initial vision and ongoing advocacy have been crucial in shaping the movement's core principles and goals. Other prominent activists, such as DeRay McKesson, Brittany Packnett, and Samuel Sinyangwe, emerged as influential voices, particularly through their involvement in initiatives like Campaign Zero, which focused on promoting policy reforms to end police brutality. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 24]]) While BLM emphasizes decentralized leadership, these individuals have played significant roles in articulating the movement's demands and mobilizing public support.

The Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) represents a broader organizational ecosystem within the BLM movement. It is a coalition comprising more than 50 groups representing the interests of Black communities across the United States, including the Black Lives Matter Global Network, the National Conference of Black Lawyers, and the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 24]]) M4BL serves as a coordinating body, facilitating communication, strategic alignment, and collective action among its member organizations, which address a wide range of issues impacting Black lives. This coalition demonstrates the interconnectedness of various groups working towards the common goal of Black liberation and highlights the diverse approaches and areas of focus within the broader movement.

The funding of the BLM movement has been multifaceted and has evolved significantly since its inception. Initially, the movement gained substantial grassroots support, fueled by widespread public outrage following high-profile incidents of police violence against Black individuals. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]) These events often acted as catalysts, mobilizing individuals to engage with the movement and contribute to its growth and activities. A significant turning point in the movement's funding came in 2020, following the murder of George Floyd, which sparked a massive surge in public awareness and support, leading to BLMGNF raising an unprecedented $90 million in donations. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 28]]) This influx of financial resources underscored the public's willingness to support movements addressing critical issues of racial injustice during moments of heightened national consciousness.

BLMGNF has played a crucial role in channeling these funds to support a wide range of initiatives within the Black liberation movement. Through its grantmaking program, the foundation has provided over $35 million in grants to more than 70 unique organizations working across various pillars, including arts and culture, frontline organizing, healing justice, policy, and research and education. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 28]]) Additionally, BLMGNF has distributed over $1.5 million in individual microgrants and scholarships through its Student Solidarity Fund and pandemic-era Survival Fund, demonstrating a commitment to providing direct financial relief to Black individuals and communities in need. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 28]]) This grantmaking activity highlights BLMGNF's role as a significant philanthropic force within the movement, amplifying its impact by supporting a diverse array of grassroots efforts.

Beyond grassroots donations, the BLM movement has also garnered support from established philanthropic networks. The Democracy Alliance, a prominent club of major liberal donors, has recommended that its members increase their financial contributions to groups supporting BLM. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]) This institutional support from influential donor networks provides BLM-affiliated organizations with access to substantial financial resources and enhances their legitimacy within the broader progressive funding landscape. This endorsement signifies a strategic alignment of major liberal donors with the goals of the BLM movement and its efforts to address systemic racism and inequality.

To streamline its financial operations and enhance its capacity for receiving tax-deductible donations, BLMGNF entered into a partnership with Thousand Currents (formerly known as IDEX) for fiduciary oversight and financial management. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 25]]) This arrangement allows BLMGNF to leverage the administrative and financial infrastructure of an established 501(c)(3) organization, ensuring compliance with regulations and facilitating more efficient management of its resources. This partnership underscores the importance of organizational infrastructure for the sustainability and effectiveness of social movements.

In an effort to promote transparency and address public scrutiny, BLMGNF has established a Transparency Center on its website, providing access to its IRS 990 forms and independent external audits. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]) This move towards greater financial disclosure aims to build public trust and counter accusations of financial mismanagement that the foundation has faced. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 25]]) While these transparency efforts are a step towards accountability, the foundation has still encountered criticism regarding its financial practices, highlighting the ongoing challenges of maintaining accountability within rapidly growing and highly visible social movements.

The funding model of the BLM movement is characterized by a diverse range of sources, including significant grassroots donations, substantial philanthropic support from foundations and donor networks, and direct community-focused grantmaking through BLMGNF. The foundation's efforts to enhance transparency through financial disclosures reflect an awareness of the need for accountability in managing the substantial resources that the movement has attracted.

Collaboration is a key feature of the BLM movement's infrastructure. The Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) itself is a coalition of over 50 organizations, demonstrating a significant level of collaboration within the broader Black liberation movement. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 24]]) This coalition serves as a vital platform for coordinating collective action, sharing resources, and developing unified strategies to address the diverse challenges facing Black communities. While there have been instances of collaboration with the Women's March, such as participation in International Women's Day events  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]), the relationship has also been marked by tensions and criticisms, particularly from BLM chapters regarding issues of intersectionality and the Women's March's commitment to addressing the specific needs of Black women. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 14]]) These complexities highlight the ongoing challenges of building and maintaining solidarity across different social justice movements, even when there are overlapping goals.

The BLM movement has also been significantly influenced by earlier activist efforts, with Occupy Wall Street being credited as an inspiration for its emergence. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]) This suggests a continuity of activist thought and a transmission of strategies and ideologies across different movements focused on addressing various forms of social and economic inequality. Furthermore, BLM has engaged in partnerships with other organizations for specific initiatives, such as its collaboration on the People's Response Act. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 29]]) These targeted alliances demonstrate a strategic approach to leveraging the expertise and resources of partner organizations to advance specific policy goals and broaden the movement's impact.

A defining characteristic of BLM's organizational structure is its emphasis on local organizing over national leadership. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 24]]) This decentralized model fosters grassroots engagement and empowers local chapters to address the specific issues and needs of their communities, allowing for a more responsive and community-driven approach to activism. This distributed leadership model has been crucial to the movement's widespread reach and its ability to adapt to diverse local contexts across the United States and beyond. The BLM movement operates through a dynamic network of collaborations at various levels, from the broad coalition of M4BL to targeted partnerships for specific campaigns, while also drawing inspiration from earlier movements and prioritizing local grassroots action.

**IV. Occupy Wall Street: Origins and Organization**

The Occupy Wall Street (OWS) protest, which began on September 17, 2011, in New York City, was conceived by Adbusters, a Canadian anti-consumerist publication founded by Kalle Lasn, with Micah White serving as its senior editor. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]) This initiative highlights the significant role that alternative media and activist publications can play in initiating social movements by framing critical issues and issuing compelling calls to action. Adbusters, known for its opposition to mainstream economic systems and its use of "culture jamming" techniques, utilized its magazine and online platforms to rally support for the occupation, focusing on themes of wealth inequality and corporate influence in politics. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 37]]) This demonstrates the power of independent media to mobilize public opinion and spark social movements, often operating outside the purview of traditional news outlets.

A defining feature of OWS was its deliberately decentralized structure, characterized by a lack of formal leaders and decision-making processes based on consensus achieved through open discussions in the "General Assembly". ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]) This leaderless model reflected an anarchist-leaning philosophy prevalent within the movement and a strong commitment to participatory democracy, aiming to empower all participants and foster a sense of collective ownership over the movement's direction and goals. The General Assembly served as the central forum for debate and decision-making, where protesters could voice their opinions and work towards consensus on various issues and actions.

While OWS lacked formal leadership roles, certain individuals emerged as influential figures within the movement. David Graeber, an anthropologist, played a prominent early role and is widely credited with coining the iconic slogan "We are the 99%". ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]) These individuals, often possessing intellectual or organizational skills, acted as informal guides and thought leaders, shaping the movement's discourse and helping to articulate its critique of economic inequality and social injustice. Their influence stemmed from their ideas and engagement within the movement rather than from any formally designated leadership position.

The initial call to action by Adbusters garnered support from a diverse range of organizations. Groups like Anonymous, a decentralized international hacktivist collective, pledged digital support and helped amplify the protest call across various online platforms. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]) New Yorkers Against Budget Cuts, which had previously organized similar occupation-style actions, provided on-the-ground support and organizing expertise. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]) Additionally, labor unions, including the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) Local 100, officially endorsed and joined the OWS protests. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]) This broad spectrum of support, ranging from online activist networks to traditional labor organizations, indicates the widespread dissatisfaction with the prevailing economic and political systems and the potential for movements to attract support from various segments of society united by common concerns.

Recognizing the importance of controlling its own narrative, OWS established its own media outlets, including _The Occupied Wall Street Journal_ and _The Occupy! Gazette_. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]) These independent publications served as crucial tools for disseminating information directly to participants and the broader public, bypassing mainstream media channels that the movement often viewed as biased or aligned with corporate interests. Through these media efforts, OWS aimed to articulate its goals, share its experiences, and counter potentially negative or dismissive portrayals in traditional news outlets, thereby maintaining a degree of control over its public image and message.

The funding of OWS primarily relied on online donations and grassroots support, reflecting its decentralized and anti-corporate ethos. The movement raised approximately $600,000, largely through online contributions made via its website (occupywallst.org) and other digital platforms. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 37]]) This highlights the effectiveness of digital fundraising for grassroots movements that may lack the traditional fundraising infrastructure of more established organizations. Additionally, the encampment in Zuccotti Park benefited from significant grassroots support, with local residents and businesses donating essential amenities such as food, wireless internet access, and even laundry services. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 38]]) This outpouring of local support underscored the movement's embeddedness within its immediate community and the sense of solidarity it fostered among participants and neighbors.

Despite its leaderless structure, OWS developed a degree of internal financial organization through the formation of a "Finance Working Group". ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 43]]) This group was responsible for managing the donations received and disbursing funds to various teams and initiatives within the movement, demonstrating an emergent form of self-governance and resource allocation. Furthermore, OWS partnered with the Alliance For Global Justice, an established non-profit organization, to receive tax-deductible donations. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 43]]) This strategic partnership provided the movement with the legal and administrative framework necessary for formal fundraising, potentially enhancing its ability to attract larger contributions from individuals and foundations. "Occupy Wall Street Media" also launched a successful Kickstarter campaign, raising over $75,000 in pledges to support the publication of _The Occupy Wall Street Journal_. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 43]]) This initiative illustrates the movement's ability to leverage crowdfunding platforms for specific projects and mobilize financial support for its communication efforts. The funding model of OWS, characterized by its reliance on online donations, grassroots support, and strategic partnerships, reflected its decentralized nature and commitment to operating outside traditional financial and political structures.

While OWS itself was relatively short-lived as a sustained occupation, it is credited with inspiring a wide range of other left-of-center protest movements, most notably Black Lives Matter and the "Fight for $15" campaign. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]) This significant legacy of influence underscores the movement's lasting impact on the activist landscape, demonstrating how a focus on core issues like economic inequality can resonate with and inform subsequent movements addressing other forms of social injustice. The "We are the 99%" slogan, popularized by OWS, also continued to resonate with later movements focused on various forms of inequality and injustice. OWS also garnered support from at least 39 labor unions and activist groups  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]), indicating a degree of solidarity and shared goals with organized labor and other progressive organizations. The hacktivist group Anonymous played a crucial role in the early stages of OWS by pledging digital support and helping to amplify the initial call for the occupation  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]), highlighting the increasing importance of online activist networks in mobilizing and supporting social movements. While there is limited evidence of direct organizational collaboration or shared leadership between OWS and the Women's March, the Women's March platform did acknowledge OWS as a significant legacy movement  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 16]]), suggesting a recognition of shared ideological space and a historical connection within the broader progressive activist community. Furthermore, OWS gained support from liberal Democratic politicians like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]), indicating its influence on political discourse and the rise of progressive political figures who championed issues of economic inequality and social justice. OWS fostered a broad range of collaborations, particularly in its early stages, and its influence on subsequent movements and political discourse underscores its lasting impact on the activist landscape, even without a centralized organizational structure.

**V. Continuity in Activist Infrastructure: From Past to Present (2025)**

Looking ahead to 2025, several potential large-scale mobilizations are anticipated, with prominent activist groups playing key organizing roles. The Women's March and the 50501 Movement are jointly organizing the People's Veto Day on April 5, 2025, to protest what they term the "MAGA assault" on the country and the Constitution. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 20]]) This planned mobilization demonstrates the continued organizational capacity of the Women's March and its willingness to collaborate with newer resistance movements. Also on April 5, 2025, a nationwide day of action known as "Hands Off!" is planned to protest the Trump administration, with the Women's March listed as a leading organization alongside MoveOn, Indivisible, BLM, the Sierra Club, and the ACLU. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]) This broad coalition highlights the interconnectedness of various progressive causes and organizations in their opposition to the current administration. International Women's Day on March 8, 2025, saw marches and rallies globally, including significant participation in the US, focusing on women's rights and expressing opposition to Trump's policies. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 33]]) This annual event continues to demonstrate the sustained relevance and mobilizing power of feminist activism. Demonstrations against Project 2025, a conservative political initiative, have already occurred in Washington D.C., organized by groups like Stand Up America  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 53]]), indicating targeted activism against specific policy agendas. Additionally, scientists organized "Stand Up For Science" marches on March 7, 2025, to protest perceived anti-scientific measures by the Trump administration  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 54]]), highlighting the growing politicization of science and the willingness of the scientific community to engage in public protest. While not activist movements, large-scale military mobilization exercises like "Operation Torch 2025" and "MOBEX" are also taking place in 2025  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 55]]), which could indirectly influence the context of social unrest or government response. Furthermore, reports discuss concerns about US readiness for high-intensity conflicts  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 58]]), which might impact political priorities and resource allocation. These various potential and actual mobilizations in 2025 indicate a continued high level of activist engagement across a range of issues.

Several organizations and leaders from past movements are publicly involved in or supporting these potential 2025 mobilizations. The Women's March organization is actively organizing and promoting events like the People's Veto Day and the "Hands Off!" protests. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]) Rachel O'Leary Carmona, the executive director of the Women's March Network, has also been vocal in her opposition to "dark money" in politics and the Trump administration's policies. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 60]]) The Black Lives Matter movement has also endorsed and is organizing events for the "Hands Off!" protests  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]), indicating its continued engagement in broader coalitions focused on resisting perceived threats to marginalized communities. While Occupy Wall Street does not exist as a unified entity leading 2025 mobilizations, its legacy of raising awareness about inequality and mobilizing public dissent continues to inspire and influence contemporary activism. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]) Individuals who were involved in OWS may very well be participating in current movements, bringing their experiences and perspectives to new struggles. While formal leadership continuity varies across the movements, with leaders from the Women's March like Carmona remaining active, the decentralized nature of BLM means leadership is distributed, and OWS lacked formal leaders from the outset, the experience and knowledge gained from these past movements likely informs and shapes the strategies and tactics of current mobilizations.

Continuity in funding sources between the past movements and current or anticipated activist activities in 2025 is also evident. Online donation platforms like ActBlue continue to be a crucial tool for fundraising across various progressive movements, including the Women's March. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 11]]) This sustained reliance on digital grassroots funding indicates a key component of activist financial infrastructure. Foundations that supported past movements likely continue to fund activist organizations working on related issues in 2025  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]), although specific details often require access to non-public financial reports. The potential for "dark money" to continue playing a role in funding activist activities, as seen in the case of the Women's March  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]), also remains a factor. BLMGNF continues its grantmaking activities, supporting organizations working for Black liberation  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 29]]), demonstrating direct financial continuity within the BLM ecosystem. Reports on philanthropic trends suggest fluctuations in funding for different social justice issues  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 63]]), which likely impact the overall funding landscape for 2025. The reliance on a diverse range of funding sources, from small online donations to foundation grants and potentially less transparent "dark money," continues to characterize the financial infrastructure of activist movements.

The evolution of online platforms and digital tools used by past movements has led to a similar infrastructure being utilized by groups organizing for 2025. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, instrumental in the initial mobilization of the Women's March, BLM, and Occupy Wall Street, remain key tools for organizing and promoting 2025 mobilizations. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 5]]) The use of hashtags, online campaigns, and rapid information dissemination continues to be central to contemporary activism. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]) Recognizing the challenge of online manipulation, the Women's March has initiatives like "Digital Defenders" to combat disinformation. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 6]]) The importance of cybersecurity for protecting activists and their communications is also increasingly recognized. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 69]]) Movements are also increasingly employing hybrid strategies, combining online campaigns with on-the-ground protests. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 66]]) Online platforms remain fundamental to activist infrastructure, with groups adapting and evolving their strategies in response to new challenges and technological advancements.

**VI. Media Analysis and Expert Perspectives**

Media analysis and expert perspectives offer valuable insights into the connections and transitions within activist infrastructure across these periods. Occupy Wall Street is frequently highlighted as an inspiration and precursor to later movements like BLM and the Women's March, particularly for raising awareness about inequality and demonstrating the potential for public dissent. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]) This suggests a historical progression where earlier movements shape the landscape for subsequent activism. BLM's focus on racial justice and systemic inequality has also influenced the framing and goals of other movements, including the Women's March's emphasis on intersectionality. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 15]]) This cross-pollination of ideas demonstrates a growing understanding of the interconnectedness of social justice issues within the activist community. The innovative use of social media for rapid mobilization and coordination, pioneered by these movements, has become a standard tactic in contemporary activism. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]) However, media coverage has also highlighted the challenges in maintaining unity and addressing internal tensions within and between these movements, such as the criticisms leveled by BLM against the Women's March. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 14]]) Established organizations like NOW have provided a consistent infrastructure across different waves of activism  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]), while newer organizations like Women's March Network have built upon this legacy. Some analyses, like the Heritage Foundation report, posit the existence of a consistent "revolutionary ecosystem" supporting these and other movements  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 72]]), though this perspective carries inherent biases. Reports also suggest a potential decline in the sheer numbers of participants in mass protests compared to the peak of the Women's March in 2017, but an increase in the frequency and diversification of protest tactics. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 73]])

Expert perspectives on future trends in activist infrastructure offer further insights. There is a suggested growing emphasis on non-cooperation as a powerful form of resistance. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 73]]) The decentralized model, particularly evident in BLM, underscores the importance of local organizing. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 24]]) Activists and movements are expected to adapt to increasing efforts to suppress protest. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 75]]) Building stronger cross-movement networks and solidarity is often highlighted as crucial for sustained impact. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 78]]) Finally, experts emphasize the importance of leveraging digital tools ethically, addressing concerns about disinformation and privacy. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 66]])

**VII. Conclusion**

The evolution of activist infrastructure in the US from the Women's March, BLM, and Occupy Wall Street to potential mobilizations in 2025 reveals both significant continuities and notable changes. Established organizations like NOW and newer entities like the Women's March Network demonstrate the ongoing role of formal structures in mobilizing activists. The decentralized network model exemplified by BLM highlights a shift towards more distributed leadership and grassroots action. Occupy Wall Street's legacy continues to inspire, even without a formal organizational presence in 2025 mobilizations.

Funding mechanisms have shown continuity, with online donations remaining a vital source of support, and foundation funding playing a significant role. The emergence and potential persistence of "dark money" as a funding source raise questions about transparency. The use of online platforms and digital tools remains fundamental, with activists constantly adapting their strategies to leverage the latest technologies while also addressing challenges like disinformation and cybersecurity.

The potential mobilizations anticipated in 2025, such as the People's Veto Day and the "Hands Off!" protests, demonstrate the ongoing involvement of organizations from past movements, particularly the Women's March and BLM, in contemporary activism. The lessons learned from these past movements, along with the evolved infrastructure, are likely to shape the nature and impact of future activist endeavors. Understanding this evolving landscape is crucial for analyzing social movements and their continuing role in shaping American society and politics.
