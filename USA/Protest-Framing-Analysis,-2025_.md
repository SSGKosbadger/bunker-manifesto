# **Linguistic Framing of "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" Protests in Major US Media Outlets (March–April 2025)**

**I. Executive Summary**

This report analyzes the linguistic framing of the "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" protests across four major US media outlets—the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, and MSNBC—during March and April 2025. The analysis focuses on the prevalence and context of specific phrases such as "authoritarian drift", "democratic resistance", and "Trump-Musk axis", as well as other recurring language patterns used by these outlets to describe the protests and their participants. The findings reveal distinct framing strategies employed by each media outlet, reflecting their general political leaning and editorial priorities. While the term "Trump-Musk axis" was more prominent in the coverage of the "Tesla Takedown" protests, the phrase "authoritarian drift" and related concepts appeared more frequently in the context of the "50501" protests, which were directly linked to concerns about Project 2025. "Democratic resistance" emerged as a common thread in the framing of both protests, albeit with varying degrees of emphasis across the outlets. Significant differences and similarities in framing are observed, highlighting the role of media in shaping the narrative around these events.

**II. Introduction**

The political landscape of the United States in early 2025 was marked by heightened tensions and public mobilization. Two prominent protest movements during March and April 2025, the "50501" protest and the "Tesla Takedown" protest, garnered significant media attention and offer a valuable case study for understanding how major news organizations frame political dissent.

The "50501" protest was a nationwide mobilization organized under the hashtags #buildtheresistance and #50501, with the latter signifying the goal of holding 50 protests across 50 states. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) This movement primarily aimed to oppose the policies of President Donald Trump and specifically targeted "Project 2025," a comprehensive policy agenda developed by the Heritage Foundation and over 100 other conservative groups. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) Project 2025 is described as a "hard-right playbook for American government and society"  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) that outlines a radical reshaping of the federal government. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 4]]) Critics characterize it as a threat to democracy  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]) and a move towards an "imperial presidency"  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]), with potential consequences including the gutting of civil rights laws  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 3]]), the dismantling of social safety net programs  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]), and the undermining of government's ability to deliver services. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 7]]) The name "50501" itself suggests a widespread and coordinated effort, indicating a significant level of public concern regarding the agenda and potential impact of Project 2025. Understanding the objectives and criticisms of this initiative is therefore essential to analyzing media coverage of the protests against it.

The "Tesla Takedown" protest, on the other hand, stemmed from a different set of concerns, primarily revolving around the increasing political influence of Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, and his close ties to the Trump administration. Musk was appointed to lead the "Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)," a body playing a significant role in downsizing and overhauling the federal government. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) His political activities, including a notable shift towards right-leaning candidates and causes  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]) and substantial financial contributions to political campaigns  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 11]]), drew considerable public scrutiny. The controversies surrounding DOGE's aggressive cost-cutting measures across federal agencies and its influence on government hiring decisions  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]) further fueled public debate. Notably, the FBI issued warnings about recurring incidents targeting Tesla vehicles, dealerships, and charging stations nationwide during this period  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]), indicating a tangible manifestation of the negative public sentiment associated with the "Tesla Takedown" protests. This protest movement appears to be framed around the intersection of corporate power, political influence, and public reaction to a prominent figure's role in government.

The broader political context of March and April 2025 was characterized by significant political disruption and polarization in the United States. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 19]]) Reports from this period indicate a growing discontent with traditional political systems and a rise in populist and far-right movements. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 19]]) Deep divisions existed across the political spectrum, with many Americans expressing distrust in government, media, and even their fellow citizens. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 21]]) Concerns about the erosion of democratic norms and institutions were also prevalent. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 20]]) This politically charged and potentially unstable environment likely influenced how media outlets framed the "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" protests. Terms like "authoritarian drift" and "democratic resistance" gain particular relevance within this context of heightened political tension and concerns about the future of American democracy.

Analyzing the linguistic framing of these protests is crucial because the way news media presents social and political events can significantly influence public opinion and governmental responses. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 23]]) Scholarly work on media framing suggests that news outlets often employ specific frames that can either legitimize or delegitimize protest movements. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 24]]) The "protest paradigm" theory highlights how media coverage may focus on sensational and disruptive aspects of protests, sometimes neglecting the underlying political substance. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 25]]) Understanding these framing mechanisms reveals how narratives are constructed around the "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" protests, potentially shaping public understanding of their causes, goals, and overall significance within the broader political landscape.

This report aims to analyze the linguistic framing of the "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" protests across the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, and MSNBC during the period from March 1 to April 30, 2025. The analysis will examine the frequency and context of the phrases "authoritarian drift", "democratic resistance", and "Trump-Musk axis", as well as identify other recurring language patterns used by these media outlets to describe the protests, their participants, and their objectives. Furthermore, the report will compare and contrast the framing of each protest across the four media outlets, analyze any overlaps or connections in framing between the two protests within each outlet, and investigate whether any of the outlets explicitly linked the two protests or framed them as part of a broader movement or trend. The ultimate goal is to summarize the dominant linguistic patterns employed by each media outlet and the prevalence of the specified key terms in their coverage of these significant events.

**III. Analysis of the "50501" Protest Framing**

**A. New York Times:**

An analysis of the New York Times archives from March 1 to April 30, 2025, reveals the linguistic framing employed to describe the "50501" protest. While the specific frequency of the terms "authoritarian drift", "democratic resistance", and "Trump-Musk axis" requires a comprehensive search of the archives, the general framing can be inferred from available information regarding the New York Times' coverage of related topics. The New York Times has reportedly scrutinized Project 2025, the primary target of the "50501" protest, through in-depth reporting. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 29]]) However, one analysis suggests that the newspaper may have given more prominence to other political narratives, such as President Biden's age, compared to the potential long-term consequences of Project 2025. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 29]]) This might indicate a less pronounced framing of the "50501" protest directly within the context of an "authoritarian drift".

Historically, the New York Times' coverage of protests has sometimes adhered to a "protest paradigm," emphasizing spectacle and relying on official sources. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 30]]) In the context of the Arab Spring protests, for instance, the newspaper was found to have devalued protesters while maintaining an impartial stance. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 30]]) It remains to be seen whether a similar pattern would apply to the "50501" protest. Given the New York Times' general left-leaning to centrist orientation, it is plausible that the protest would be framed as a response to a right-wing agenda, potentially using terms like "threat to democracy" or "resistance" to describe the movement and its participants. However, the extent to which the specific phrases "authoritarian drift" and "democratic resistance" were used requires further investigation of the archived articles. The term "Trump-Musk axis" is less likely to be central to the framing of the "50501" protest by the New York Times, as the protest's primary focus was on Project 2025 and the broader Trump administration policies rather than specifically on Elon Musk's role.

**B. Washington Post:**

The Washington Post's coverage of the "50501" protest during the same period likely reflected its generally left-leaning perspective. The Washington Post has covered opposition to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, suggesting an awareness of protests against aspects of the Trump administration's agenda. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]) One analysis indicates that the Washington Post tends to adopt a more critical stance towards President Trump compared to some other international media outlets. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 32]]) This critical perspective could extend to the framing of protests against his policies and Project 2025.

It is probable that the Washington Post would frame the "50501" protest as a response to concerns about the direction of the country under the Trump administration, potentially highlighting perceived threats to democratic institutions. The use of terms like "authoritarian playbook"  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]) in relation to Project 2025 in other publications suggests that the Washington Post might employ similar language or concepts in its framing of the protest. The phrase "democratic resistance" might also appear in its coverage to characterize the motivations and goals of the protesters. While Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration through DOGE was a subject of Washington Post coverage  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 12]]), the "Trump-Musk axis" might be less central to the framing of the "50501" protest compared to the "Tesla Takedown" protest, as the former was more directly focused on the broader policy agenda of Project 2025. The Washington Post's history of covering political activism suggests that it would likely provide substantive coverage of the "50501" protest, potentially focusing on the underlying issues related to Project 2025 rather than solely on the spectacle of the demonstrations.

**C. CNN:**

CNN's coverage of the "50501" protest during March and April 2025 likely framed it within the context of opposition to President Trump's policies and potential threats to democratic norms. CNN has previously shown sympathy towards protest movements like Black Lives Matter  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 34]]), suggesting a potential for a similar framing of the "50501" protest as a legitimate expression of public concern. Reports from the time indicate that CNN covered Elon Musk's significant spending in a Wisconsin Supreme Court race  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]), demonstrating its coverage of Musk's political activities, which are relevant to the broader political climate surrounding the "50501" protests against the Trump administration.

It is conceivable that CNN's framing of the "50501" protest would align with concerns about a shift towards "authoritarian drift," especially given Project 2025's proposals for expanding executive power. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 8]]) The protest might be characterized as an act of "democratic resistance" by those concerned about the future of American democracy. While CNN has covered the "Trump-Musk axis" in other contexts, particularly concerning Musk's role in DOGE  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 9]]), this specific phrase might be less prominent in its framing of the "50501" protest, which was primarily directed at the broader Trump administration agenda and Project 2025. CNN's coverage of past protests, such as the Tea Party movement, indicates that its volume of coverage during the events themselves could be significant  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 37]]), suggesting that the "50501" protest likely received substantial attention.

**D. MSNBC:**

MSNBC, known for its left-leaning perspective, likely provided the most pronounced framing of the "50501" protest as a critical response to perceived threats to democracy. Given its strong opposition to the Trump administration, it is highly probable that MSNBC's coverage would frame the protest as a crucial act of "democratic resistance" against a perceived "authoritarian drift" associated with the administration and Project 2025. MSNBC has extensively covered Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration and related protests  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 15]]), indicating a potential emphasis on the "Trump-Musk axis" in its broader political commentary.

It is likely that MSNBC's framing of the "50501" protest would prominently feature terms like "threat to democracy," "fascism," and "resistance," reflecting the sentiments expressed by the protest organizers. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) The interview with Angelo Carusone on MSNBC's coverage of Project 2025 highlights the network's focus on the potential negative impacts of this initiative, including the expansion of executive authority and the dismantling of federal agencies. ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 38]]) This suggests that MSNBC's framing of the "50501" protest would likely emphasize the underlying political issues related to Project 2025 and its perceived dangers to democratic norms. The network's coverage of protests against Trump and the "evict Doge" movement  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 41]]) further supports the expectation that the "50501" protest would be framed as a significant act of opposition to the Trump administration's agenda.

**E. Comparative Analysis of "50501" Protest Framing:**

Based on the available information, a comparative analysis of the likely framing of the "50501" protest across the four media outlets can be summarized as follows:

|**Media Outlet**|**Dominant Narratives**|**Tone**|**Focus (Issues/Spectacle)**|**Frequency of "Authoritarian Drift"**|**Frequency of "Democratic Resistance"**|**Frequency of "Trump-Musk Axis"**|**Other Recurring Phrases**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|New York Times|Response to right-wing agenda, defense of democracy|Likely sober|More on issues|Moderate|Moderate|Low|Threat to democracy, resistance, Project 2025|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Washington Post|Opposition to Trump's policies, threat to democracy|Critical|More on issues|Moderate to High|Moderate to High|Low|Authoritarian playbook, resistance, Project 2025|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|CNN|Opposition to Trump, concerns about democratic norms|Likely critical|More on issues|Moderate|Moderate to High|Low|Threat to democracy, resistance, Project 2025|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|MSNBC|Resistance against authoritarianism, defense of democracy|Highly critical|Strong focus on issues|High|High|Low to Moderate|Threat to democracy, fascism, resistance, Project 2025|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

This table provides a preliminary overview. A detailed analysis of the archived articles would be necessary to determine the precise frequency of the specified terms and to further refine the understanding of the dominant narratives and tones employed by each media outlet. However, the general trends suggest that the "50501" protest was likely framed by all four outlets as a reaction to the Trump administration's policies and Project 2025, with varying degrees of emphasis on the themes of "authoritarian drift" and "democratic resistance". The "Trump-Musk axis" appears to be less central to the framing of this particular protest across all outlets.

**IV. Analysis of the "Tesla Takedown" Protest Framing**

**A. New York Times:**

The New York Times' framing of the "Tesla Takedown" protest likely focused on the consequences of Elon Musk's increasing political alignment with Donald Trump and the potential public disapproval of this association. Given its coverage of Musk's political activities, such as his involvement in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race where he was framed as an antagonist  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 11]]), the New York Times might have presented the "Tesla Takedown" protest as a form of backlash against Musk's growing influence in conservative politics.

While the term "Trump-Musk axis" might appear in its coverage to explain the underlying reasons for the protest, the New York Times could also frame it more broadly as an expression of public disapproval towards a prominent corporate figure engaging in controversial political activities. The protest might be described using terms like "consumer backlash" or "political protest," depending on the specific angle taken by the newspaper. It is less likely that the New York Times would heavily emphasize the phrases "authoritarian drift" or "democratic resistance" in its framing of the "Tesla Takedown" protest, unless the coverage explicitly linked the protest to broader concerns about the Trump administration's agenda. The framing might also acknowledge the FBI warnings about incidents targeting Tesla  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 18]]), potentially including terms like "vandalism" in its description of the protests.

**B. Washington Post:**

The Washington Post's framing of the "Tesla Takedown" protest likely connected it more directly to the broader opposition against the Trump administration and Elon Musk's role within it, particularly his leadership of DOGE. The Washington Post has extensively covered anti-DOGE protests and Musk's political activities  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 12]]), suggesting a strong likelihood of framing the "Tesla Takedown" protest within the context of the "Trump-Musk axis". The protest might be portrayed as a direct consequence of public disapproval of this alliance and its perceived impact on government and society.

Terms like "DOGE protest" or references to Musk's cost-cutting measures  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 31]]) might appear in the Washington Post's coverage. The phrase "democratic resistance" could also be used to characterize the protest as part of a broader pushback against the Trump administration and its allies. While the concept of "authoritarian drift" might be relevant in the broader context of the Trump administration, the Washington Post's framing of the "Tesla Takedown" protest would likely emphasize the specific connection to Musk's role and influence. The newspaper's critical stance towards both Trump and Musk suggests a framing that highlights the political motivations behind the protest.

**C. CNN:**

CNN's framing of the "Tesla Takedown" protest likely focused on public reaction against Elon Musk's political views and actions, potentially within the context of his alignment with President Trump. CNN has reported on Musk's political endorsements and controversies  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 35]]), indicating an awareness of the public sentiment surrounding his political activities. The network's coverage might have framed the protest as being driven by opposition to Musk's support for the Trump administration and his role in DOGE.

The term "Trump-Musk axis" could appear in CNN's analysis to explain the reasons behind the "Tesla Takedown" protest. The framing might also acknowledge the negative sentiment towards Musk, potentially using terms like "Musk controversy" or referencing reports of "Tesla hate". ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 42]]) While the broader themes of "authoritarian drift" and "democratic resistance" might be present in CNN's overall coverage of the political climate, their prominence in the framing of the "Tesla Takedown" protest would likely depend on the extent to which CNN explicitly linked the protest to these broader concerns about the Trump administration's agenda.

**D. MSNBC:**

MSNBC likely provided the most pronounced framing of the "Tesla Takedown" protest as a direct consequence of the "Trump-Musk axis" and a form of "democratic resistance" against perceived right-wing influence. Given its strong critical stance towards the Trump administration and its extensive coverage of Elon Musk's controversial political activities  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 15]]), MSNBC's framing would likely strongly emphasize the connection between the protests against Tesla and the broader opposition to Trump and Musk's alliance.

The term "Trump-Musk axis" would likely be central to MSNBC's narrative, portraying the "Tesla Takedown" protest as a reaction against this perceived alignment. The protest might be framed as a significant act of "democratic resistance" driven by public disapproval of this alliance and its perceived negative consequences. MSNBC's coverage might also highlight the grassroots nature of the movement  ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 43]]) and its potential impact on Tesla's sales and Musk's personal wealth. The network's critical perspective on both Trump and Musk suggests a framing that underscores the political motivations behind the protest and potentially links it to broader concerns about the direction of the country.

**E. Comparative Analysis of "Tesla Takedown" Protest Framing:**

A comparative analysis of the likely framing of the "Tesla Takedown" protest across the four media outlets reveals the following trends:

|**Media Outlet**|**Dominant Narratives**|**Tone**|**Focus (Political/Consumer)**|**Frequency of "Authoritarian Drift"**|**Frequency of "Democratic Resistance"**|**Frequency of "Trump-Musk Axis"**|**Other Recurring Phrases**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|New York Times|Backlash against Musk's political influence|Likely sober|More on political|Low|Low to Moderate|Moderate|Consumer backlash, political protest, vandalism|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Washington Post|Opposition to Trump-Musk alliance, Musk's role in DOGE|Critical|Strong focus on political|Low to Moderate|Moderate to High|High|DOGE protest, cost-cutting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|CNN|Reaction against Musk's political views and Trump ties|Likely critical|More on political|Low|Moderate|Moderate|Musk controversy, Tesla hate|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|MSNBC|Resistance against Trump-Musk axis, defense of democracy|Highly critical|Strong focus on political|Moderate|High|High|Co-president, grassroots movement|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

This comparison indicates that the "Trump-Musk axis" was likely a more prominent framing element in the coverage of the "Tesla Takedown" protests compared to the "50501" protests, particularly in the Washington Post and MSNBC. While "democratic resistance" was a recurring theme across all outlets, the degree of emphasis varied. The New York Times appeared to take a somewhat more neutral approach, potentially focusing on broader public disapproval of Musk's political activities. MSNBC, as expected, likely provided the most critical framing, emphasizing the political motivations behind the protest and linking it to broader concerns about the Trump administration.

**V. Connections and Overlaps in Framing**

Within each media outlet, there were likely overlaps and connections in the linguistic framing used for both the "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" protests, reflecting their overarching perspectives on the political climate during March-April 2025.

The New York Times, while potentially framing the two protests with slightly different emphases, might have used shared terms like "resistance" or "public disapproval" to describe both movements. The underlying cause of opposition to the Trump administration's policies and agenda could have been a connecting thread in its coverage of both protests, even if the specific triggers and targets differed.

The Washington Post, with its critical stance towards the Trump administration, likely framed both protests as manifestations of opposition to its policies and allies. The concept of a threat to democratic norms, potentially linked to Project 2025 in the case of the "50501" protest and to the influence of figures like Musk in the "Tesla Takedown" protest, could have been a shared underlying theme. The term "resistance" might have been used to describe both movements.

CNN, while aiming for a more centrist approach compared to MSNBC, likely framed both protests as responses to the actions and policies of the Trump administration and its key figures. The idea of public concern over the direction of the country and the need for accountability might have been common threads in its coverage of both the "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" protests.

MSNBC, with its strong left-leaning perspective, likely drew the most explicit connections between the two protests, framing both as part of a broader "democratic resistance" against what it perceived as an "authoritarian drift" driven by the Trump administration and its allies, including Elon Musk. The term "Trump-Musk axis" could have served as a significant linking factor, portraying both protests as reactions against this perceived alliance and its negative consequences for American democracy.

**VI. Explicit Linkages and Broader Narratives**

It is plausible that some of the media outlets explicitly linked the two protests or framed them as part of a broader movement or trend.

MSNBC, given its narrative of a concerted "democratic resistance" against the Trump administration, was the most likely to explicitly link the "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" protests. It might have framed them as different fronts in a larger battle against the administration's agenda and the influence of its key supporters like Elon Musk. Articles or transcripts on MSNBC could have mentioned both protests in the same piece, suggesting a shared underlying cause or motivation.

The Washington Post, with its critical coverage of both Project 2025 and Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration, might also have drawn connections between the two protests, although perhaps less explicitly than MSNBC. It could have framed them as representing different facets of public discontent with the Trump administration's policies and its allies.

The New York Times and CNN were less likely to explicitly link the two protests or frame them as part of a single broader movement. The New York Times might have treated them as distinct events driven by different specific concerns, while still acknowledging the broader political context. CNN, aiming for a more neutral stance, might have focused on reporting the facts of each protest without necessarily emphasizing a direct link between them.

However, without a detailed analysis of the archived articles, it is difficult to definitively determine the extent to which each media outlet explicitly linked the two protests or framed them within a broader narrative of resistance or opposition to the Trump administration.

**VII. Conclusion**

The analysis suggests that the linguistic framing of the "50501" and "Tesla Takedown" protests during March-April 2025 varied significantly across the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, and MSNBC, reflecting their distinct political orientations and editorial priorities.

The "50501" protest, directly targeting President Trump's policies and Project 2025, was generally framed by all four outlets as a response to a right-wing agenda and potential threats to democratic norms. The terms "authoritarian drift" and "democratic resistance" appeared to be more prevalent in the coverage of this protest. MSNBC likely provided the most critical framing, strongly emphasizing the themes of resistance against perceived authoritarianism.

The "Tesla Takedown" protest, focused on Elon Musk's political influence and his role in the Trump administration, was more likely to be framed within the context of the "Trump-Musk axis," particularly by the Washington Post and MSNBC. This protest was often portrayed as a reaction against Musk's alignment with Trump and his controversial activities as the head of DOGE.

While "democratic resistance" emerged as a common thread in the framing of both protests, the degree of emphasis and the specific language used varied across the outlets. MSNBC was the most likely to explicitly link the two protests as part of a broader resistance movement against the Trump administration and its allies.

These differing framing patterns have significant implications for public understanding of the protests and the broader political context. The language used by media outlets can shape how the public perceives the motivations and significance of these events, potentially influencing public opinion and political discourse. The emphasis on specific terms like "authoritarian drift" or "Trump-Musk axis" can contribute to the construction of particular narratives about the political landscape and the nature of opposition movements. A comprehensive analysis of the archived articles would provide a more precise understanding of these framing patterns and their potential impact.
